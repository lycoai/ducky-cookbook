    "question": "A 32-year-old man with chronic plaque psoriasis presents to your clinic seeking long-term control of his disease. He has previously experienced good clearance with topical steroids but relapses quickly when they are stopped. He is concerned about steroid-induced skin atrophy with prolonged use. He is otherwise healthy and prefers a topical treatment with evidence of remission beyond the period of active therapy. Which of the following medications best matches his goals?",
    "choices": [
      "Calcipotriene 0.005% and betamethasone dipropionate 0.064% ointment",
      "Halobetasol propionate 0.01% and tazarotene 0.045% lotion",
      "Tapinarof cream",
      "Roflumilast cream",
      "PUVA phototherapy"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Tapinarof is a topical aryl hydrocarbon agonist that has demonstrated potential remittive effects (sustained benefit after discontinuation) in long-term extension studies. This characteristic distinguishes it from other topical therapies, which generally require ongoing use for maintenance. While halobetasol/tazarotene and calcipotriene/betamethasone combinations are effective, their remittive effects after discontinuation are less established, and the patient is concerned about steroid-related risks. Roflumilast is well-tolerated but has not shown superior remittive effect. PUVA is generally reserved for more severe or extensive disease and carries long-term skin cancer risk."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with persistent, mild acne vulgaris involving the T-zone of her face. She has tried numerous over-the-counter face washes, with limited improvement. She is interested in starting chemical peels. On examination, her skin is moderately oily with numerous open and closed comedones, without significant erythema or post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. She also reveals concerns about potential irritation and wants a peel that may help exfoliate without significant downtime. Which of the following agents is the MOST appropriate choice for her skin condition?",
    "choices": [
      "30% Glycolic acid peel (\u03b1-hydroxy acid)",
      "20% Salicylic acid peel (\u03b2-hydroxy acid)",
      "Tretinoin peel",
      "Trichloroacetic acid (TCA) 35%",
      "Pyruvic acid peel"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Salicylic acid (a \u03b2-hydroxy acid) is oil-soluble and can penetrate into sebaceous units, making it particularly effective for comedonal and oily acne. It reduces cell adhesion, is keratinolytic, and promotes exfoliation by eliminating the outermost layer of the stratum corneum. It is also self-neutralizing, reducing the risk of prolonged irritation. \u03b1-hydroxy acids like glycolic acid primarily affect the lowest levels of the stratum corneum but are less effective for very oily, comedonal acne. Tretinoin peels and high concentration TCA are more irritating and not first-line for mild acne. Pyruvic acid is less studied in this context."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with a 3-week history of an erythematous, violaceous, indurated plaque on his right thigh, accompanied by low-grade fever and malaise. He reports that the lesion began as a tender nodule and has gradually enlarged, with some central ulceration over the past several days. There is no history of trauma, insect bite, or preceding infection. Laboratory results reveal mild leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers. A deep skin biopsy demonstrates a predominantly neutrophilic infiltrate within the subcutaneous fat, with evidence of fat necrosis but no significant vasculitis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Nodular vasculitis (erythema induratum)",
      "Lupus profundus (lupus panniculitis)",
      "Subcutaneous Sweet syndrome (neutrophilic panniculitis)",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes a deep, tender nodule with systemic symptoms and biopsy showing a neutrophilic infiltrate and fat necrosis without significant vasculitis\u2014traits characteristic of subcutaneous Sweet syndrome (a neutrophilic panniculitis). Erythema nodosum typically shows septal panniculitis without vasculitis and is less likely to ulcerate. Nodular vasculitis presents with lobular panniculitis and vasculitis, while lupus profundus features lymphocytic infiltrate with hyaline fat necrosis. Pyoderma gangrenosum often shows a mixed infiltrate and rapidly progressing ulcer with undermined borders."

    "question": "A 21-year-old woman presents with persistent acne lesions that are unresponsive to over-the-counter topical therapies. She reports experiencing worsening outbreaks around her menstrual cycle and excessive facial oiliness. Examination reveals numerous closed comedones and inflammatory papules concentrated over the forehead and cheeks, with some scattered nodules. There is no evidence of hirsutism, but she admits to irregular menses. Based on the pathogenesis of acne vulgaris, which of the following BEST explains the primary process leading to her clinical presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Upregulation of matrix metalloproteinases in the epidermis leading to dermal matrix breakdown",
      "Overactivation of toll-like receptor 2 (TLR-2) on keratinocytes by C. acnes, triggering inflammation",
      "Direct invasion of the epidermis by Staphylococcus aureus causing neutrophilic abscesses",
      "Progesterone-induced atrophy of sebaceous glands resulting in follicular rupture",
      "Mutation in filaggrin gene causing abnormal barrier function and increased transepidermal water loss"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The pathogenesis of acne vulgaris involves several key factors, including abnormal keratinization leading to microcomedo formation, increased sebum production, and the activity of Cutibacterium acnes (formerly Propionibacterium acnes). C. acnes contributes to inflammation by producing short-chain fatty acids, activating TLR-2 on keratinocytes, which triggers the inflammatory response characteristic of acne. The clinical scenario highlights hormonal influences (irregular menses and perimenstrual flares), which increase sebum production and foster an environment for C. acnes proliferation, leading to TLR-2 activation. The other choices do not correctly reflect the core mechanisms of acne vulgaris pathogenesis as described in the reference material."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man presents with pruritic, erythematous plaques on his arms and trunk that have appeared over the last 2 weeks. He reports increased itching and a burning sensation following the use of a new scented body lotion. On physical exam, there are ill-defined, edematous plaques with overlying fine scaling. A lesional biopsy demonstrates epidermal spongiosis, parakeratosis, and abundant dermal eosinophils. Which additional histopathologic feature, if present, would best support a diagnosis of allergic contact dermatitis over urticarial bullous pemphigoid or arthropod bite reaction?",
    "choices": [
      "Parakeratosis with eosinophils concentrated at the dermo-epidermal junction",
      "Intraepidermal spongiosis with numerous dyskeratotic keratinocytes",
      "Superficial and deep dermal perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates with scattered eosinophils",
      "Well-circumscribed dermal nodule composed of polygonal clear cells",
      "Spongiosis with parakeratosis and prominent eosinophils throughout the epidermis"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Allergic contact dermatitis is characterized by spongiosis (intercellular edema of the epidermis), parakeratosis (retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum), and the presence of eosinophils predominately within the epidermis. In contrast, urticarial bullous pemphigoid shows eosinophils lining up at the dermo-epidermal junction, while arthropod bite reactions more commonly have deep inflammation with eosinophils. Scattered dyskeratotic keratinocytes are seen in incontinentia pigmenti, not in allergic contact dermatitis. Thus, 'spongiosis with parakeratosis and prominent eosinophils throughout the epidermis' best supports allergic contact dermatitis."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with a rapidly growing, pink, 1.5 cm dome-shaped nodule on his left cheek. The lesion is non-pigmented, firm, and somewhat tender. He reports no significant personal or family history of skin cancer. Dermatoscopic evaluation is inconclusive, and an excisional biopsy is performed. Histopathology reveals a dermal proliferation of large epithelioid and spindle cells with abundant cytoplasm and atypical nuclei. Immunohistochemical stains are positive for S100 and SOX-10, but also for MITF. However, diagnostic uncertainty remains as the lesion is poorly pigmented and highly atypical. Molecular testing reveals a gain of 11p and an activating HRAS mutation. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Desmoplastic melanoma",
      "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor",
      "Spitz nevus",
      "Conventional melanocytic nevus",
      "Blue nevus"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The presence of a gain of 11p and activating HRAS mutation is characteristic of Spitz nevus. While S100, SOX-10, and MITF are sensitive melanocytic markers, they are not specific and can be positive in both melanoma and Spitz nevi. The molecular findings are most consistent with Spitz nevus, ruling out melanoma (which typically shows BRAF or NRAS mutations and chromosomal gains/losses such as 9p21 loss), blue nevus (GNAQ/GNA11 mutations), and conventional nevus (BRAF/NRAS mutations without 11p gain). Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor may stain with S100 but not with the melanocytic markers and lacks these molecular features."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled diabetes and chronic hepatitis C presents with several months of painless blisters and erosions on the dorsum of his hands and forearms. He works outdoors and reports that the lesions worsen in the summer. Examination reveals tense, non-inflammatory bullae, some healing with milia and atrophic scars. Laboratory investigations reveal mild transaminitis. A punch biopsy of a blister shows a subepidermal split with minimal inflammatory infiltrate, thickened capillary walls with a PAS-positive fibrin cuff, festooning of the papillary dermis, and caterpillar bodies in the epidermis. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrates linear deposition of IgG, IgM, IgA, C3, and fibrinogen at the basement membrane zone and around dermal blood vessels. Indirect immunofluorescence is negative. Under Wood\u2019s lamp, a urine sample appears coral-red. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate high-dose systemic corticosteroids",
      "Begin regular phlebotomy to lower serum iron",
      "Start high-potency topical corticosteroids under occlusion",
      "Treat with high-dose oral antifungals",
      "Begin dapsone and monitor for hemolysis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is classic for porphyria cutanea tarda (PCT), characterized by painless blisters on sun-exposed skin, histopathology with subepidermal split and minimal inflammation, PAS-positive vessel wall thickening ('fibrin cuff'), festooning, and caterpillar bodies. DIF shows linear immunoreactant deposition at the basement membrane and around vessels. Urine showing coral-red fluorescence under Wood's lamp is highly specific. Management involves avoidance of triggers, sun protection, phlebotomy to lower iron (which inhibits uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase), and sometimes low-dose antimalarials. High-dose corticosteroids, dapsone (for neutrophil-mediated disorders), antifungals, and topical steroids are not indicated in PCT."

    "question": "A 56-year-old woman presents with red, painful nodules on her lower legs that have been present for several weeks. Some nodules have ulcerated and healed with scarring. She has no significant past medical history, but notes mild fatigue. Examination reveals tender subcutaneous nodules on the posterior calf, a few with overlying ulceration. A biopsy taken from a nodule demonstrates neutrophilic vasculitis with leukocytoclasis and fibrin deposition around a medium to large artery at the dermal\u2013subcutaneous fat junction, with no evidence of lobular panniculitis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Polyarteritis nodosa",
      "Thrombophlebitis",
      "Erythema induratum",
      "Wegener's granulomatosis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The biopsy findings of neutrophilic vasculitis with leukocytoclasis and fibrin deposition around a large artery at the dermal\u2013subcutaneous fat junction are characteristic for polyarteritis nodosa (PAN). Clinically, ulcerating nodules on the lower legs with healing by scarring fit PAN. Erythema induratum features lobular panniculitis, not seen here. Thrombophlebitis involves veins rather than arteries. Erythema nodosum is a septal panniculitis and does not demonstrate vasculitis. Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis typically presents with small-vessel vasculitis and often upper respiratory involvement."

    "question": "A 58-year-old woman presents to clinic one week after cosmetic facial surgery with asymmetry of her smile. On examination, when she smiles, the left side of her mouth does not evert the vermilion border as well as the right, resulting in a 'crooked' smile. She is otherwise able to close her eyelids and wrinkle her forehead, but is unable to fully show her teeth on the affected side. Which surgical complication best explains her findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Injury to the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve (CN VII)",
      "Injury to the marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve (CN VII)",
      "Injury to the temporal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII)",
      "Injury to the buccal branch of the facial nerve (CN VII)",
      "Injury to the great auricular nerve"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The marginal mandibular branch of CN VII innervates the muscles of the lower lip, including those responsible for eversion of the vermilion border during smiling. Injury to this branch produces a 'crooked' smile that is most noticeable when the patient smiles and less so at rest. The zygomatic branch controls the orbicularis oculi and injury results in eyelid ectropion. The temporal branch innervates the forehead and superior orbicularis oculi. The buccal branch affects the upper lip and nasal muscles. The great auricular nerve is sensory and is not responsible for smiling."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with a 3-month history of asymptomatic, non-blanching reddish-brown macules and patches on his lower legs. The lesions have slowly increased in number and have a distinctive 'cayenne pepper' appearance. He denies pain or systemic symptoms. On examination, there are multiple well-demarcated petechial macules and patches on both shins. A skin biopsy reveals superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with RBC extravasation and hemosiderin deposition, without significant epidermal changes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Schamberg\u2019s disease",
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Lichen aureus",
      "Purpura annularis telangiectodes of Majocchi",
      "Pigmented purpuric lichenoid dermatitis of Gougerot and Blum"

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Schamberg\u2019s disease is a variant of pigmented purpuric dermatosis characterized by 'cayenne pepper' petechial macules, most commonly on the lower legs. Histology shows a superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with extravasated erythrocytes and hemosiderin deposition, without significant epidermal changes. Other listed options either have different clinical or histopathological features."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents to the clinic with a pruritic eruption on his hands and wrists, which has worsened over several weeks. He has noticed new, linear, erythematous papules and excoriated burrows on the web spaces of his fingers. He has no significant past medical history. A skin scraping is performed and sent for histopathological examination. Under the microscope, you observe numerous round objects within the stratum corneum, brown amorphous debris, empty egg shells with spiral forms, and a prominent lymphoeosinophilic infiltrate in the underlying dermis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Norwegian scabies",
      "Myiasis (fly larva infestation)",
      "Tick bite",
      "Tungiasis",
      "Cutaneous larva migrans"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histologic findings are classic for scabies. The presence of mites, ova, scybala (brown excretions), and empty eggshells (seen as chitin scrolls and pigtails) within the stratum corneum, along with a brisk lymphoeosinophilic infiltrate in the dermis, is diagnostic for scabies. Norwegian scabies is a severe, hyperkeratotic variant with massive mite burden; however, standard scabies also shows these findings but without marked hyperkeratosis. Myiasis shows larva with a chitinous wall and pigmented spikes, not seen here. Tick bite histology features wedge-shaped necrosis and retained mouthparts. Tungiasis affects acral locations and shows musculature in the organism. Cutaneous larva migrans is not associated with these histologic features."

    "question": "A 7-year-old child presents with patchy, scaly hair loss and broken hairs on the scalp. The diagnosis of tinea capitis is confirmed by fungal culture, which grows Microsporum canis. The parents are concerned about treatment options and possible side effects. Which of the following is the most appropriate pharmacologic therapy for this patient, and why is it preferred over the alternatives?",
    "choices": [
      "Oral terbinafine, because it is fungicidal against Microsporum species and has minimal relapse rate.",
      "Oral fluconazole, as it is highly effective against dermatophytes and also treats possible yeast co-infection.",
      "Topical ketoconazole, as topical therapy is effective for scalp dermatophytosis in children and avoids systemic side effects.",
      "Oral griseofulvin, because it is effective against dermatophytes like Microsporum and absorption is increased with fatty food.",
      "Oral posaconazole, as it is FDA-approved for both Candida and dermatophyte infections and prevents relapse."
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Oral griseofulvin is the drug of choice for tinea capitis caused by dermatophytes such as Microsporum species. While overall cure rates may be higher for Trichophyton species, griseofulvin remains most effective against Microsporum. Its absorption is enhanced with a fatty meal, which can help optimize dosing. Terbinafine is more effective against Trichophyton but less effective against Microsporum. Topical therapy is not effective in tinea capitis. Fluconazole is not highly effective for dermatophytes, and posaconazole is not indicated for this indication."

    "question": "A 66-year-old fair-skinned man with a history of sun exposure presents with a rapidly enlarging, crateriform nodule on his right forearm that developed over the past 4 weeks. The lesion is dome-shaped with a central keratin-filled crater. He reports a similar lesion spontaneously regressed several years ago. Biopsy reveals a well-circumscribed lesion with proliferation of squamous epithelium, keratinization, and no evidence of deep tissue invasion. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Begin systemic chemotherapy due to high metastatic risk",
      "Observe for possible spontaneous regression",
      "Wide local excision with clear surgical margins",
      "Initiate radiotherapy to the affected region",
      "Elective lymph node dissection despite negative clinical nodes"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Keratoacanthoma is a rapidly growing cutaneous tumor that is controversial in its classification as either a benign lesion or a well-differentiated variant of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC). While some keratoacanthomas may spontaneously regress, excision is generally recommended because distinguishing them from invasive SCC can be difficult and there exists a risk of progression. Wide local excision with clear surgical margins is the preferred management to ensure complete removal and histological evaluation, avoiding both over- and under-treatment. Systemic chemotherapy, radiotherapy, or elective lymph node dissection are not first-line in this scenario, especially with no clinical or radiological evidence of metastasis."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents with a 4-month history of yellow, indurated papules with surrounding erythema and prominent telangiectasias, predominantly involving the periorbital region. He denies pruritus or pain. Review of systems is notable for recent onset of blurred vision and mild dyspnea on exertion. Past medical history is significant for well-controlled hypertension. Skin biopsy reveals granulomatous inflammation with zonal necrobiosis and cholesterol clefts; direct immunofluorescence is negative. Laboratory evaluation demonstrates a monoclonal IgG\u03ba spike. Which of the following is the most likely systemic complication to actively screen for in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Renal amyloidosis",
      "Restrictive cardiomyopathy",
      "Diabetic nephropathy",
      "Hepatic cirrhosis",

    "explanation": "This patient\u2019s presentation is characteristic of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma, which is strongly associated with paraproteinemia, particularly IgG\u03ba. This condition may have extracutaneous involvement including the lungs and heart. Restrictive cardiomyopathy\u2014a form of cardiac systemic involvement\u2014occurs due to granulomatous or infiltrative disease. Screening for cardiac (restrictive cardiomyopathy) and pulmonary involvement is essential. Other options, such as renal amyloidosis (A), diabetic nephropathy (C), hepatic cirrhosis (D), and pulmonary arterial hypertension (E), are not classic complications of necrobiotic xanthogranuloma."

On examination, the lesion is 1.3 cm in diameter, jet-black with areas of blue and gray, and has irregular, indented borders. There is slight elevation of the central portion but the edges remain flat. Dermoscopic examination reveals multiple colors, including black, brown, and pink areas, with some regression structures. She denies a history of trauma at the site and reports no symptoms. She has a history of frequent sun exposure but no family history of skin cancer. Which of the following is the most likely type of melanoma in this patient?",

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a lesion with asymmetry, variegated color (black, brown, blue, gray, pink), irregular and indented borders, and a slight elevation in the center with a larger flat periphery\u2014classic features of superficial spreading melanoma. This is the most common melanoma type in white populations, typically found on the lower legs of women. Nodular melanoma is usually a uniformly raised nodule without the pronounced multicolor evolution or flat edge. Lentigo maligna melanoma most often affects chronically sun-exposed skin in older individuals, especially the face. Acral lentiginous melanoma preferentially affects palms, soles, and nail beds, and desmoplastic melanoma has a scar-like appearance. Therefore, superficial spreading melanoma (choice A) is most likely."

The infant is otherwise well, with normal vital signs and no systemic symptoms. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of this phenomenon?",
    "choices": [
      "Abnormal proliferation of melanocytes in the epidermis",
      "Immature autoregulation of cutaneous vasculature leading to transitory vasodilation",
      "Hemolysis due to phototherapy for hyperbilirubinemia",
      "Subcutaneous fat necrosis caused by hypoxia at birth",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The described clinical scenario points to Harlequin color change, which typically presents as a transient, sharply demarcated erythematous discoloration of one-half of the body in newborns. This occurs due to immature hypothalamic control of vascular tone, resulting in localized vasodilation. It is benign, transient, and not associated with any underlying disease. Other options\u2014such as subcutaneous fat necrosis (sclerema neonatorum), hemolysis, or vascular birthmarks\u2014do not present with these features."

Examination reveals a necrotic ulcer with hemorrhagic bullae. He also reports low-grade fever and malaise. Histopathology of a skin biopsy from the lesion reveals septate hyphae branching at 45-degree angles. What is the most likely causative organism?",

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman undergoes treatment with a pulsed dye laser for facial telangiectasia. During the procedure, she forgot to wear her protective eye goggles. Shortly after, she experiences darkening of her vision and central scotoma. Which structure of the eye is most likely injured, and what is the main mechanism of damage?",
    "choices": [
      "Cornea; photokeratitis due to ultraviolet exposure",
      "Retina; photothermal injury from visible wavelength absorption",

      "Cornea; corneal burn from infrared C exposure",
      "Iris; pigmentary dispersion from thermal damage"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The pulsed dye laser emits light at 595 nm, which is within the visible range. According to the tables, lasers with wavelengths in the visible spectrum are primarily a risk to the retina due to both photochemical and thermal mechanisms. If eye protection is inadequate, the retina is most susceptible to injury from visible lasers, resulting in symptoms like vision loss or scotoma. The other options do not correspond to the expected injury from a pulsed dye laser."

The mother reports that at birth, the baby appeared encased in a shiny, taut membrane that resolved after a few weeks. Examination reveals widespread serpiginous, erythematous plaques with double-edged scales as well as signs of atopic dermatitis and recurrent skin infections. On further review, the child has a history of failure to thrive and diarrhea, and a hair mount reveals trichorrhexis invaginata ('bamboo hair'). Which of the following genetic defects is most likely responsible for this patient's condition?",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Sculptra (poly-L-lactic acid) is preferred for a patient who desires gradual restoration of volume and is concerned about an 'overfilled' look. It stimulates collagen production, leading to subtle, progressive improvement over weeks to months. HA fillers provide immediate results, Radiesse gives structural support but is more prone to give an instant, sometimes firmer correction, silicone is discouraged due to permanent complications, and botulinum toxin addresses dynamic lines, not volume loss."

While the patient has some systemic symptoms (arthralgia, photosensitivity), there are not enough major systemic findings or serological markers (e.g., negative anti-dsDNA) to suggest SLE or acute cutaneous LE. SCLE typically presents with annular or papulosquamous lesions, often without scarring. Lupus panniculitis would present as deep, nodular lesions. The absence of acute features and scarring supports DLE."

    "question": "A 16-year-old girl presents with diffuse hair thinning that began 3 months ago following a severe bout of infectious mononucleosis. She reports increased hair shedding when brushing her hair. There are no patches of complete hair loss, the scalp appears normal without erythema or scaling, and there is no evidence of scarring. On examination, a gentle pull test yields several hairs with white bulbs at the end. Her lab work, including thyroid function and iron studies, is normal. Which of the following best explains the underlying pathophysiology of her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Inflammatory destruction of hair follicles leading to fibrosis",
      "Premature conversion of hair follicles from anagen to telogen phase",
      "Inherited mutation affecting keratin structure in the hair shaft cortex",
      "Androgen-mediated miniaturization of hair follicles",
      "Trichotillomania causing mechanical hair shaft breakage"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes acute, diffuse, non-scarring hair loss following a stressful event (infectious mononucleosis), a typical trigger for telogen effluvium. Telogen effluvium is driven by stress-induced premature conversion of hair follicles from the anagen (growth) phase to the telogen (resting/shedding) phase. This leads to increased shedding, often with club (white) bulbs at the end of the hairs, and is not associated with inflammation, scarring, or miniaturization."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes presents with a three-day history of progressive facial swelling and mild erythema on the left cheek. He reports recent dental extraction and now has developed areas of necrosis with thick, black hemorrhagic crusts over the cheek. He is febrile, and examination reveals unilateral facial edema with extensive necrosis and some purulent drainage. A skin biopsy is performed. Histopathology shows broad, nonseptate hyphae with right-angle branching. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "High-dose intravenous voriconazole and hyperbaric oxygen therapy",
      "Oral fluconazole and outpatient follow-up",
      "Debridement and intravenous amphotericin B",
      "High-dose corticosteroids and surgical decompression",
      "Observation and empirical antibiotics for cellulitis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This is a classic case of cutaneous mucormycosis, especially in a diabetic patient following dental trauma. The diagnosis is supported by the clinical picture and histopathology showing broad, nonseptate hyphae with 90-degree (right-angle) branching. The appropriate management is prompt surgical debridement and intravenous amphotericin B, as mucormycosis is rapidly progressive and often fatal if not treated aggressively. Other options, including more common antifungals (voriconazole, fluconazole) and corticosteroids, are ineffective and can worsen the disease."

    "question": "A 2-week-old infant is brought to the clinic by her parents, who noticed a dimple on her lower back at the top of the gluteal cleft during bathing. On examination, there is a midline sacral pit surrounded by a patch of coarse terminal hair, and an adjacent soft, non-tender mass is palpable under the skin. There are no neurologic deficits at this time. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Observation and reassurance; these features are typical and benign in neonates.",
      "Obtain lumbosacral spine MRI to further evaluate for underlying spinal dysraphism.",
      "Refer urgently for surgical intervention without further imaging.",
      "Order plain radiographs of the lumbosacral spine to rule out bony defects.",
      "Schedule an outpatient follow-up at 12 months to monitor for neurological changes."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient has multiple cutaneous markers of spinal dysraphism (midline sacral dimple, hypertrichosis, and a subcutaneous mass likely representing a lipoma). According to the provided reference, the presence of any two or more cutaneous findings in the lumbosacral region is high risk for underlying spinal dysraphism, and MRI is the imaging of choice for detection. Ultrasound may be used in infants under 4 months when MRI is not readily available but is less sensitive. Early, accurate diagnosis is important to prevent neurological sequelae. Observation, plain radiographs, or delayed follow-up are not appropriate as they may miss an opportunity for early intervention. Urgent surgery is not indicated without imaging to clarify anatomy."

The lesions are skin-colored, arranged in linear clusters, and do not ulcerate. On examination, some patches show overlying hypertrichosis. Family history reveals her mother had similar cutaneous lesions and a history of uterine fibroids. A skin biopsy from a lesion reveals bundles of spindled cells with blunt-ended nuclei and perinuclear clearing, without nuclear pleomorphism or mitotic figures. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Smooth muscle hamartoma",
      "Angioleiomyoma",
      "Reed's syndrome (cutaneous leiomyoma)",
      "Leiomyosarcoma",
      "Angiomyolipoma"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes multiple cutaneous papulonodular lesions in a linear distribution, overlying hypertrichosis (seen sometimes in smooth muscle hamartomas, but more pronounced in leiomyomas), and a familial history of similar lesions and uterine fibroids\u2014characteristic of Reed\u2019s syndrome (hereditary leiomyomatosis and renal cell cancer syndrome). Histology shows fascicles of smooth muscle cells with blunt-ended nuclei and perinuclear clearing, classic for leiomyoma, without the pleomorphism or mitoses of leiomyosarcoma. Angioleiomyoma is usually a solitary lesion, not multiple and inherited. Smooth muscle hamartoma is a patch or plaque-like lesion, not nodular and multiple. Angiomyolipoma is a mixed adipose and vascular tumor, seen in the kidney."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man underwent Mohs micrographic surgery for two distinct skin lesions: a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) on the left cheek and a squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on his right hand. Due to positive margins on frozen section for the cheek lesion, he required a staged excision two days later during a separate surgical encounter. The initial excision and immediate repair were performed on both lesions by different practitioners on the same day. Which set of CPT modifiers should be reported to most accurately and compliantly code for these multiple procedures and encounters?",
    "choices": [
      "Modifier 59 for both cheek and hand excisions and repair on the initial day; Modifier 58 for the staged excision two days later.",
      "XS for hand procedures, XE for the staged cheek excision, and XP for repairs done by different practitioners.",
      "XP for hand excision, XS for cheek excision, and 58 for the staged procedure.",
      "XS for hand excision and repair, XP for repairs by different practitioners, and 58 for the staged cheek excision.",
      "XE for staged excision, XS for hand excision, and XP for different practitioners on the same day."
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer applies the new X modifiers as follows: XS (separate structure) for procedures on different anatomical sites (hand vs. cheek), XP (separate practitioner) if repairs were performed by different practitioners, and 58 (staged procedure) for the planned, separate excision due to positive margins. Modifier 58 is used for the staged excision (not XE, which refers to a separate encounter on the same calendar day). This combination provides the most accurate and compliant coding given the clinical scenario."

    "question": "A 53-year-old woman presents with multiple flat-topped, violaceous, polygonal papules on her wrists and ankles, associated with pruritus. She also has white, lacy patches on her buccal mucosa. A biopsy reveals a dense, band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal junction, numerous civatte bodies, hypergranulosis, saw-tooth appearance of the rete ridges, and pigment incontinence. There is no evidence of parakeratosis or eosinophils. Which of the following would most likely be seen if her disease began to resolve?",
    "choices": [
      "Marked increase in parakeratosis and eosinophils within the inflammatory infiltrate",
      "Diffuse acanthosis and thickened stratum corneum throughout the biopsy",
      "Prominent dermal melanophages with fibrosis and occasional residual civatte bodies",
      "Widespread subepidermal blistering with neutrophil-predominant infiltrate",
      "Focal vacuolar alteration of basal keratinocytes with extensive dermal mucin"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Resolving lichen planus demonstrates prominent dermal melanophages due to pigment incontinence from destroyed basal keratinocytes, along with fibrosis and occasional residual civatte bodies. This reflects the post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation and scarring phase of lichenoid dermatitis. Parakeratosis and eosinophils would suggest a drug-induced lichenoid eruption, not classic or resolving lichen planus. Diffuse acanthosis and thickened stratum corneum are seen in hypertrophic lichen planus, not in the resolving stage. Blistering with a neutrophilic infiltrate and extensive dermal mucin are features of other dermatoses, such as bullous disorders and connective tissue diseases, respectively."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man undergoes excisional surgery for a basal cell carcinoma located on the dorsal hand. The surgeon requires precise forceps for handling delicate tissue during the procedure to minimize trauma, given the area's functional and cosmetic importance. Later in the procedure, the same surgeon needs to remove fine suture material from the fingertip after wound closure. Which of the following is the best combination of forceps for these distinct tasks?",
    "choices": [
      "Adson forceps for the excision and Jeweler\u2019s forceps for suture removal",
      "Foerster forceps for both excision and suture removal",
      "Adson forceps with teeth for both excision and suture removal",
      "Bishop-Harmon forceps for excision and Jeweler\u2019s forceps for suture removal",
      "Bishop-Harmon forceps for excision and Adson forceps for suture removal"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "For delicate work on the hand, Bishop-Harmon forceps are preferred over Adson forceps, as they are lightweight and fine-tipped, ideal for precision and minimizing tissue trauma. For suture removal, Jeweler\u2019s forceps are the instrument of choice due to their sharp tip and precision. Adson forceps are more suitable for larger, less delicate areas such as the trunk and proximal extremities."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents to the clinic with a 5-day history of a painful genital ulcer and tender unilateral inguinal lymphadenopathy. He reports no prior similar episodes and denies new medications or systemic symptoms. Physical examination reveals a single, well-demarcated, soft ulcer on the penile shaft with irregular margins and a purulent base; the surrounding skin is erythematous. There are no vesicles, and the remainder of the examination is unremarkable. He has a history of unprotected sexual contact while traveling in Central America two weeks prior. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment for his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Benzathine penicillin G intramuscularly",
      "B. Azithromycin orally",
      "C. TMP-SMX orally",
      "D. Doxycycline orally",
      "E. Ciprofloxacin intravenously"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient's presentation is most consistent with chancroid, which is caused by Haemophilus ducreyi and presents as a painful soft ulcer with irregular margins and unilateral painful inguinal lymphadenopathy. Treatment options for chancroid include azithromycin orally, ceftriaxone intramuscularly, ciprofloxacin orally, or erythromycin orally. Benzathine penicillin G is used for syphilis, TMP-SMX is not indicated, and doxycycline is not first line for chancroid. While ciprofloxacin is an option, the most widely recommended and convenient first-line therapy is azithromycin orally."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with pruritic, erythematous plaques on his forearms that recently appeared after starting a new topical antibiotic. Histologically, a biopsy reveals a superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils. The epidermis shows mild spongiosis, but there is no significant epidermal necrosis or blister formation. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology underlying his skin findings?",
    "choices": [
      "A. IgE-mediated mast cell degranulation causing immediate hypersensitivity",
      "B. T-cell mediated delayed-type hypersensitivity attracting eosinophils",
      "C. Circulating immune complexes depositing in the dermal vessels",
      "D. Autoantibodies targeting hemidesmosomal proteins in the basement membrane",
      "E. Direct invasion of the dermis by parasitic larvae"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes an allergic contact dermatitis, which is a classic example of a dermal hypersensitivity reaction. The biopsy findings (lymphocytic infiltrate with eosinophils, mild spongiosis, no significant epidermal changes) align with a delayed-type (Type IV) hypersensitivity reaction. T-cells are the main effectors, and they attract eosinophils to the site. This distinguishes it from immediate (IgE-mediated) hypersensitivity, which would have more mast cell activity and urticarial findings, or from autoantibody-mediated diseases (like bullous pemphigoid), immune complex vasculitis, and direct parasitic invasion."

    "question": "A 24-year-old man with severe nodulocystic acne has been on oral isotretinoin for six weeks. He subsequently develops persistent low mood, loss of interest in activities, insomnia, and expresses vague suicidal ideation to his dermatologist. He has no prior psychiatric history, substance use, or family history of mood disorders. His other medications include doxycycline (stopped when isotretinoin was started) and topical benzoyl peroxide. Laboratory investigations are unremarkable. Which of the following is the MOST appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Discontinue isotretinoin immediately and refer urgently to psychiatry",
      "Continue isotretinoin and initiate a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)",
      "Continue isotretinoin and arrange close psychiatric follow-up while monitoring his mood",
      "Switch from isotretinoin to oral antibiotics and refer to psychiatry",
      "Reduce the dose of isotretinoin while providing supportive counseling"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Isotretinoin has been associated with rare but severe psychiatric adverse effects, including depression and suicidal ideation. Given the onset of new psychiatric symptoms and suicidal ideation in a patient with no previous history, immediate discontinuation of isotretinoin and urgent psychiatric referral is warranted to minimize risk. Continued isotretinoin, even with close monitoring or initiation of antidepressants, is not recommended in the context of emergent suicidality. Lowering the dose or switching drugs without addressing the acute psychiatric risk is not safe. Multidisciplinary acute management takes priority."

    "question": "A 62-year-old man with a longstanding history of poorly controlled diabetes presents with numerous indurated, violaceous plaques over the lower extremities. Several plaques demonstrate ulceration with central necrotic crusts. Laboratory studies show elevated serum calcium levels. A skin biopsy of an ulcer border (processed with standard formalin fixation and paraffin embedding) reveals extensive dermal and subcutaneous vascular calcification, with associated vascular thrombosis and fat necrosis. The dermatopathologist wishes to specifically assess for the presence of calcium deposits within vessels in this routinely processed tissue. Which of the following special stains would be most appropriate, and what is the expected appearance of the deposit?",
    "choices": [
      "Alizarin red: Calcium stains red",
      "Von Kossa: Calcium phosphate stains black",
      "Pentahydroxy flavanol: Calcium fluoresces",
      "Masson trichrome: Calcium stains blue-green",
      "Feulgen: Calcium stains magenta"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Von Kossa stain is the preferred special stain for demonstrating calcium phosphate in formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissues. Calcium salts (phosphate, carbonate) appear black with the Von Kossa stain because the stain detects anionic phosphate/carbonate by silver reduction. Alizarin red is also used for calcium, but is more commonly applied to frozen tissue, and produces a red coloration. Pentahydroxy flavanol is a fluorochrome for calcium, not typically used on routine paraffin slides. Masson trichrome is for collagen and muscle, not calcium. Feulgen is specific for DNA, not calcium. Thus, Von Kossa is the correct answer, with calcium deposits appearing black."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with patchy hair loss of two months\u2019 duration. On exam, she has several discrete, round, non-scarring areas of alopecia on her scalp with preserved follicular openings. Dermoscopy reveals yellow dots within the alopecic patches. A biopsy from the affected area shows increased telogen hair count, peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate, and dilated follicular infundibula. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Androgenetic alopecia",
      "Alopecia areata",
      "Chronic telogen effluvium",
      "Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia",
      "Lichen planopilaris"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Alopecia areata is characterized histologically by increased telogen hair count, peribulbar lymphocytic inflammation (the so-called 'swarm of bees'), and dilated follicular infundibula that appear as yellow dots on dermoscopy. The clinical finding of well-demarcated, non-scarring patches of hair loss with preserved follicular openings and the described histopathology are most consistent with alopecia areata. Androgenetic alopecia shows miniaturized hairs and scant inflammation. Chronic telogen effluvium presents with increased telogen hairs but without inflammation or miniaturization. Both central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia and lichen planopilaris are scarring alopecias, presenting with follicular destruction and perifollicular fibrosis, not compatible with this case."

On examination, there is a 0.7 cm localized, fluctuant nodule at the eyelid margin with a visible yellowish point and surrounding erythema, draining small amounts of purulent material to the skin surface. There is mild associated edema, but the mucosal surface of the eyelid is uninvolved. Which of the following structures is most likely inflamed in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Meibomian glands",
      "Glands of Zeis",
      "Glands of Moll",
      "Glands of Krause",
      "Eccrine sweat glands"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This presentation describes an acute hordeolum (external stye), which is an infection of the Glands of Zeis, sebaceous glands located on the eyelid margin that empty into the skin. Key features are involvement of the eyelid margin, purulent drainage to the skin, and rapid onset. Meibomian gland inflammation produces a chalazion and typically involves the mucosal (conjunctival) surface. The Glands of Moll are apocrine, and the Glands of Krause are accessory lacrimal glands, both less likely to present this way. Eccrine sweat glands are not implicated in eyelid margin infections."

Histopathology shows a well-circumscribed, keratin-filled crater with hyperkeratosis, acanthosis, and strands of atypical squamous cells extending into the dermis. There is also perineural and vascular invasion evident, but only sparse dermal inflammation. Which of the following best characterizes the clinical significance of the perineural and vascular invasion seen in this case?",
    "choices": [
      "It is a hallmark of metastatic squamous cell carcinoma and indicates aggressive disease requiring wide excision and nodal dissection.",
      "It is a typical feature of keratoacanthoma and does not by itself indicate malignant transformation or poor prognosis.",
      "It suggests that the lesion is a basal cell carcinoma with infiltrative growth pattern.",
      "It is diagnostic of Muir-Torre syndrome and mandates genetic testing for DNA mismatch repair deficiency.",
      "It is a nonspecific finding and is not seen in any benign or malignant cutaneous neoplasms."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Perineural and vascular invasion are features that, in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), indicate a significant risk of aggressive and metastatic behavior. However, in keratoacanthoma (KA), these findings may be present and are not, by themselves, indicators of malignancy or poor prognosis. Therefore, in the context of the histopathology and clinical scenario provided, this finding does not equate to aggressive disease as it would in SCC, but rather is a known phenomenon in KA and should not alter management as it might with SCC."

He reports mild pruritus but no associated joint pain. His past medical history is unremarkable except for seasonal allergic rhinitis. He has previously tried topical steroids and emollients with minimal improvement. Recent biopsy of a lesion reveals marked acanthosis, parakeratosis, and neutrophilic microabscesses in the stratum corneum. Analysis of his lesional skin shows markedly increased expression of IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-36, as well as high levels of a heterodimeric cytokine composed of p19 and p40 subunits. Which of the following targeted therapies would be most appropriate to reduce his disease activity?",
    "choices": [

      "Anti-IgE antibody (omalizumab)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient has chronic plaque psoriasis, as evidenced by thick, scaly plaques and classic histopathology. IL-17A, IL-22, and IL-36 are all TH17 pathway cytokines highly relevant in psoriasis. IL-23, a heterodimer of p19 and p40, is crucial for TH17 cell survival and proliferation, and its blockade is highly effective in treating psoriasis. Guselkumab (anti-IL-23p19 antibody) specifically targets the p19 subunit of IL-23 and is approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. The other options are therapies for atopic dermatitis (dupilumab), eosinophilic disorders (mepolizumab), general autoimmune disease and psoriasis (adalimumab, but IL-23 inhibitors are considered more targeted in this scenario), and allergic asthma/urticaria (omalizumab)."

He has no significant past medical history, but notes having developed a rash after taking amoxicillin as a child, though he does not recall details. On examination, you note widespread, non-follicular pustules on a background of edematous erythema, particularly in the flexural areas, but no mucosal involvement or systemic symptoms. What is the most likely cause of his current eruption?",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient's rapid onset of numerous, non-follicular pustules on edematous erythema, particularly in intertriginous areas, after starting penicillin (amoxicillin-clavulanate) is most suggestive of acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP). AGEP is a well-documented, acute, and distinctive hypersensitivity reaction to penicillins, often occurring within days, without mucosal involvement or systemic toxicity. Urticaria, Stevens-Johnson syndrome (which features mucosal involvement and targetoid lesions), small vessel vasculitis (which presents with palpable purpura), and fixed drug eruption (well-defined, recurring patches) do not fit the clinical picture described."

It is a classic example of a septal panniculitis without true vasculitis on histology. It may leave post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Associations include inflammatory bowel disease, sarcoidosis, infections, and medications. Nodular vasculitis and erythema induratum are forms of lobular panniculitis, often with vasculitis, and usually occur on the posterior legs.

    "explanation": "The clinical presentation is classic for erythema nodosum (EN)\u2014tender nodules on lower legs, healing with hyperpigmentation and minimal scarring, and absence of systemic symptoms. Biopsy of EN typically shows a septal panniculitis (inflammation in the septa dividing fat lobules) without associated vasculitis. 'Miescher radial granulomas' are pathognomonic for EN. Erythema induratum (choice 2) is usually a lobular panniculitis with vasculitis and ulceration, and often affects posterior lower legs, but is less likely without granulomatous vasculitis. Lupus profundus/classic lobular panniculitis (choice 3) usually involves deep dermis and subcutis, with lymphocytic infiltrate, mucin deposition, and hyaline fat necrosis. Pancreatic panniculitis (choice 4) features 'ghost' adipocytes and is usually associated with pancreatic disease.

      "She should avoid only products labeled as containing formaldehyde, since quaternium-15 is unrelated.",
      "She should avoid all products with formaldehyde and formaldehyde-releasers, since cross-reactivity is universal.",
      "She should avoid quaternium-15 specifically, as not all patients allergic to it are allergic to formaldehyde.",
      "She should avoid all seafood because formaldehyde is present in some preserved fish and cross-reactivity is common.",
      "She has a contact urticaria, not allergic contact dermatitis, and can continue using the products safely."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Quaternium-15 is a common cosmetic preservative that can cause allergic contact dermatitis and is a formaldehyde releaser. However, not all patients allergic to quaternium-15 are allergic to formaldehyde itself. Therefore, the most accurate advice is to avoid quaternium-15 specifically; avoidance of all formaldehyde-containing products is not definitively required unless allergy to formaldehyde is also demonstrated."

    "question": "A 9-month-old boy is brought to the emergency department with a 2-day history of fever, irritability, and widespread redness and tenderness of the skin, particularly around the mouth, axillae, and groin. Over the past 12 hours, he developed generalized flaccid blisters; several have ruptured, leaving areas of denuded skin. On examination, the Nikolsky sign is positive. The parents note the infant has been otherwise healthy, with no recent exposures. Laboratory studies reveal normal white blood cell count and negative blood cultures. A swab of blister fluid fails to grow any organisms. Which of the following findings would most help distinguish between staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome (SSSS) and bullous impetigo in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Presence of subcorneal separation on skin biopsy",
      "Isolation of Staphylococcus aureus from blister fluid",
      "Positive Nikolsky's sign on examination",
      "Mucous membrane involvement",
      "Age of the patient"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The key distinguishing feature between SSSS and bullous impetigo is the location of the bacteria. In SSSS, toxin-mediated cleavage of desmoglein 1 causes blisters, but blister fluid is sterile because the mechanism is systemic and not due to local infection; the causative Staphylococcus aureus is found at distant mucosal sites (e.g., nares, rectum), not in the blister. In contrast, in bullous impetigo the blisters are caused by a local toxin, and bacteria are present in the blister fluid. Both conditions may show subcorneal separation on histology, primarily affect young children, and have similar clinical presentations, but only bullous impetigo features positive cultures from blister fluid."

    "question": "A 57-year-old man underwent excision of a basal cell carcinoma on his left cheek under local anesthesia. Immediately post-procedure, he developed perioral numbness and mild agitation. Ten minutes later, he became hypotensive, tachycardic, and developed urticaria over the chest and neck. Which component of the local anesthetic mixture is most likely responsible for this systemic reaction?",
    "choices": [
      "Lidocaine base",
      "Epinephrine",
      "Methylparaben preservative",
      "Diphenhydramine",
      "Sodium bicarbonate"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "While true allergy to amide anesthetics (like lidocaine) is rare, systemic allergic reactions can sometimes be caused by preservatives, such as methylparaben, used in multi-dose vials. Methylparaben can act as an allergen and is structurally similar to para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA), a known allergen in ester anesthetics. Epinephrine usually causes local vasoconstrictive and cardiac effects, but rarely systemic allergy. Diphenhydramine is an antihistamine; sodium bicarbonate is a buffer. Thus, the most likely culprit in this scenario is methylparaben preservative."

    "question": "A 15-year-old adolescent presents with a 2-month history of recurrent crops of reddish-brown papules on the trunk and limbs. Some lesions rapidly evolve into vesicles, become necrotic or purpuric, and later heal with small, pitted scars. The patient is otherwise healthy but reports mild malaise at the onset of flare-ups. On examination, there are clusters of papules at various stages of evolution, some with crusts and varioliform scarring. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta (PLEVA)",
      "Pityriasis lichenoides chronica (PLC)",
      "Lichen planus",
      "Pityriasis rubra pilaris",
      "Lichen spinulosus"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "PLEVA (pityriasis lichenoides et varioliformis acuta) is characterized by acute crops of papules that may become vesicular, necrotic, or purpuric and heal with varioliform (pitted) scars. The presence of lesions at various stages and scarring is typical. PLC is more chronic and heals with hypopigmentation but without scarring. Lichen planus, PRP, and lichen spinulosus do not commonly present with this acute necrotic evolution and scarring pattern."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic with complaints of intensely pruritic, edematous papules on both lower legs and forearms. The symptoms started 24 hours after returning from a camping trip in a rural, tropical area. He reports that several friends who camped with him noticed similar lesions, but none had any systemic symptoms. Physical examination reveals clusters of erythematous papules with central puncta, and a few vesicles, mostly around the ankles and wrists. He denies fever, myalgia, or joint pain. Which of the following is the most likely vector responsible for his cutaneous findings, and what is the primary method of prevention?",
    "choices": [
      "Sandfly; permethrin-treated clothing",
      "Anopheles mosquito; anti-malarial prophylaxis",
      "Aedes mosquito; use of insect repellents containing DEET",
      "Black fly; rapid start of ivermectin",
      "Tsetse fly; avoidance of freshwater activities"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This clinical presentation describes typical mosquito bites, characterized by pruritic, edematous papules, often with a central punctum, and sometimes vesiculation, primarily on exposed skin. Among mosquitoes, Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex are important genera, and all can cause cutaneous reactions. However, Aedes mosquitoes are particularly common in tropical, rural settings, but Aedes, Anopheles, and Culex can cause similar bite reactions. Prevention of mosquito bites relies primarily on the use of insect repellents containing DEET rather than permethrin-treated clothing (more important for ticks) or anti-malarial prophylaxis (which is to prevent malaria specifically, not cutaneous reactions). Sandfly, black fly, and tsetse fly bites are associated with specific diseases (leishmaniasis, onchocerciasis, African trypanosomiasis, respectively), and their presenting features would differ. Therefore, the best answer is the Aedes mosquito with DEET-based repellents as primary prevention."

    "question": "A 22-year-old woman presents with multiple flesh-colored papules and nodules on her face, particularly around the nose and on the scalp. She also notes a gradual development of pearly papules on the trunk since adolescence. Her father had similar facial lesions and required surgery for a collapsing nasal bridge from tumor growth. Physical exam reveals multiple small, firm papules on the face, some coalescing into larger nodules, as well as patchy areas of scarring alopecia on the scalp. She has no history of blistering or systemic symptoms. Biopsies in the past have shown adnexal tumors with cylindromatous and trichoepitheliomatous features. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome (Gorlin Syndrome)",
      "Bazex Syndrome",
      "Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome",
      "Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 Syndrome",
      "Familial Cylindromatosis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Brooke-Spiegler Syndrome is characterized by the development of multiple adnexal tumors, most notably cylindromas, spiradenomas, and trichoepitheliomas, predominantly on the head and neck. Familial inheritance is common. The syndrome can cause scarring alopecia from scalp lesions, and lesions often coalesce on the face and scalp. Basal Cell Nevus Syndrome and Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 may have overlapping features but are distinguished by other findings (such as basal cell carcinomas and pulmonary cysts, respectively). Familial cylindromatosis mainly causes multiple cylindromas without the full spectrum of Brooke-Spiegler tumors."

    "question": "A 46-year-old woman presents with a 6-month history of persistent, mildly pruritic, scaly patches on her buttocks and medial thighs. She previously received topical corticosteroids from her primary care physician without significant improvement. On exam, hypo- and hyperpigmented, thin, scaly patches with indistinct borders are noted, predominantly on non-sun-exposed skin. There is no lymphadenopathy and no systemic symptoms. Laboratory investigations, including a lipid profile, are normal. A skin biopsy reveals epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes without significant spongiosis or fungal elements. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Psoriasis vulgaris",
      "Mycosis fungoides (cutaneaous T-cell lymphoma)",
      "Verruciform xanthoma",
      "Chronic eczema",
      "Lichen planus"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes patches in photoprotected sites, which are thin and scaly, resistant to topical steroids, with no systemic involvement or lymphadenopathy. Histology reveals epidermotropism of atypical lymphocytes, which is characteristic of patch-stage mycosis fungoides (MF), a form of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Psoriasis and eczema typically exhibit more pronounced spongiosis or parakeratosis without atypical lymphocyte infiltration. Verruciform xanthoma occurs mainly in anogenital/periorificial areas and is not associated with lymphocytic epidermotropism or photoprotected predilection. Lichen planus usually has violaceous, flat-topped papules."

    "question": "A 17-year-old male presents with complaints of malodor in his axillae, which worsens under stress but is minimal during sleep. He recalls that the issue began around puberty. On examination, there are no signs of erythema, scaling, or broken skin, and his general skin condition is good. The odor resolves temporarily with topical antibacterial soap but returns later. Which of the following glands is most likely responsible for this clinical presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Eccrine glands located throughout the body's skin",
      "Sebaceous glands associated with hair follicles on the face",
      "Apocrine glands in the axillary region",
      "Meibomian glands in the eyelids",
      "Ceruminous glands in the external ear canal"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient's symptoms\u2014malodor in the axillae beginning at puberty, worsening with emotional stress, and being absent during sleep\u2014are characteristic of apocrine gland activity. Apocrine glands, found in the axillae, begin functioning at puberty and secrete an initially odorless fluid that acquires odor after bacterial breakdown. Eccrine glands produce watery sweat for thermoregulation and are not responsible for body odor. Sebaceous, Meibomian, and ceruminous glands have different anatomical locations and functions. Thus, the correct answer is apocrine glands in the axillary region."

    "question": "A 31-year-old man with poorly controlled HIV presents with a rapidly progressive, necrotic ulcer on the palate and involvement of the maxillary alveolus. He complains of fever, headache, and nasal congestion. Examination reveals a black eschar on the hard palate, tender facial swelling, and a few scattered violaceous papules on his trunk. Fungal stain of a tissue biopsy reveals broad, non-septate hyphae that branch at right angles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Pulmonary aspergillosis",
      "Cryptococcosis",
      "Mucormycosis (zygomycosis)",
      "Penicilliosis",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation (an immunocompromised host with rapidly progressive necrotic ulcer of the palate, facial swelling, and black eschar) and the histology (broad, non-septate hyphae with right-angle branching) are classic for mucormycosis (zygomycosis). Aspergillus typically presents with thin, septate hyphae branching at acute angles. Cryptococcosis and penicilliosis usually have yeast-like cells on histology, not broad hyphae. Phaeohyphomycosis is characterized by pigmented, septate hyphae."

On examination, the lesion is flesh-colored and firm, measuring 2.5 cm, with areas of telangiectasia and a recently developed ulcer. The patient reports occasional bleeding. There are no palpable lymph nodes. Histopathology reveals aggregates of small round blue cells with a high mitotic index and no keratinization. Immunohistochemistry is positive for cytokeratin 20 in a perinuclear dot pattern. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?",
    "choices": [
      "Poorly differentiated squamous cell carcinoma",

He reports occasional joint pain and a recent sore throat. His lesions flare periodically after episodes of pharyngitis. Despite topical glucocorticoids, his plaques have become thickened and extensive. He is considering systemic therapy. Which of the following statements best reflects the most appropriate next step in his management and the relevant systemic associations to consider?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate psoralen plus UVA phototherapy, given its lower risk of secondary skin cancer and lack of systemic disease associations.",
      "Prescribe narrow-band UVB phototherapy; also advise screening for metabolic syndrome components such as diabetes and hypertension.",
      "Add topical anthralin for superior efficacy in chronic plaque-type psoriasis and evaluate for concurrent viral hepatitis infection.",
      "Start vitamin D3 analogs, as they promote keratinocyte proliferation, and screen for ulcerative colitis only if bowel symptoms develop.",
      "Recommend tar therapy as first-line for moderate psoriasis, and warn about increased risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Narrow-band UVB is considered a first-line treatment for moderate psoriasis because it is effective and has a lower risk of secondary nonmelanoma skin cancer compared to psoralen plus UVA (PUVA). Also, psoriasis is associated with systemic conditions such as Crohn\u2019s disease, ulcerative colitis, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes, so it is important to screen for metabolic syndrome components. The other options contain inaccuracies regarding efficacy, safety, and systemic associations."

She also notices occasional red, painless eyes but no fever or systemic symptoms. Her past medical history is notable only for mild asthma. Laboratory investigations reveal raised serum ACE and hypercalcemia. A skin biopsy of a plaque demonstrates non-caseating 'naked' granulomas in the dermis with sparse lymphocytes. Polarized light examination fails to reveal refractile material. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cutaneous sarcoidosis",
      "Granuloma annulare",
      "Foreign body granuloma",
      "Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei",
      "Necrobiosis lipoidica"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Cutaneous sarcoidosis is suggested by the chronic, indurated violaceous facial plaques, non-caseating 'naked' granulomas on histology, and the presence of systemic features including eye involvement and laboratory abnormalities (increased ACE, hypercalcemia). Granuloma annulare usually presents as annular lesions on extremities. Foreign body granuloma would reveal foreign material on polarized light. Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei typically has suppurative granulomas on the face in younger adults, but histology differs. Necrobiosis lipoidica is characterized by yellowish, atrophic plaques on the shins with palisading granulomas histologically."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with worsening pruritic, exudative eczema on both antecubital fossae. The skin is moist, weeping, and inflamed. Previous attempts at applying topical corticosteroids prescribed as an ointment were met with patient dissatisfaction due to greasiness and poor spreadability. He is now requesting a formulation that will help manage the weeping but is cosmetically acceptable and easy to apply to an area with occasional hair growth. Which of the following would be the most appropriate vehicle for his topical corticosteroid?",
    "choices": [
      "Ointment",
      "Cream",
      "Lotion",
      "Gel",
      "Foam"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Lotions have a drying effect as they evaporate and are particularly useful in the treatment of moist, exudative dermatoses such as this patient's weeping eczema. They are more cosmetically acceptable than ointments and are easier to apply to larger or hairy areas than creams or ointments. Gels also dry quickly and are suitable for hair-bearing areas, but the alcohol base may be irritating on inflamed or open skin. Foams are appealing but may be cost prohibitive and are not specifically indicated for exudative states. Thus, lotion is the best alternative here."

The lesion started as a small red papule after she adopted a new kitten, and has slowly grown. On examination, you observe a single, annular, erythematous plaque with a raised, scaly border and central clearing. There are small pustules at the advancing edge. She reports using a topical corticosteroid cream for the last several days, prescribed by her primary care physician. The lesion is now less scaly and more erythematous, but continues to expand. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Allergic contact dermatitis from the corticosteroid base",
      "Tinea corporis caused by Trichophyton rubrum",
      "Majocchi granuloma (fungal folliculitis)",
      "Tinea incognito",
      "Nummular eczema"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient has a classic presentation of tinea corporis (annular lesion with scaling and central clearing, animal exposure), initially, but her use of topical corticosteroids has altered the clinical appearance, making it less scaly and more erythematous \u2013 a phenomenon known as tinea incognito. Tinea incognito is a dermatophyte infection with atypical features due to prior topical steroid treatment. Majocchi granuloma is unlikely here as there are no nodular folliculocentric lesions and no mention of deeper follicular involvement. Allergic contact dermatitis or eczema would not have the annular, advancing edge or animal history."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with progressive patchy hair loss over her scalp. On examination, the affected areas reveal smooth, round patches of complete hair loss without scaling or erythema. Gentle traction on the hair at the periphery of the patches yields easily extractable hairs. Microscopic examination shows hair shafts with tapered proximal ends ('exclamation point' hairs). To guide her prognosis, which of the following cellular processes is MOST directly responsible for initiating new anagen hair growth in these alopecic regions?",
    "choices": [
      "Activation of matrix keratinocytes within the bulb region",
      "Hyperproliferation of vellus hair follicles",
      "Activation and transient proliferation of bulge region epithelial stem cells",
      "Recruitment of dermal dendritic cells to the outer root sheath",
      "Increased melanocyte activity in the hair papilla"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The bulge region of the outer root sheath in the hair follicle contains epithelial stem cells, which are crucial for initiating the hair cycle, particularly the transition into the anagen (growth) phase. According to the 'bulge-activation hypothesis,' these stem cells undergo transient proliferation, giving rise to transient amplifying cells that migrate downward to become matrix keratinocytes. The matrix keratinocytes then form the hair shaft. Thus, in alopecic regions, it is the activation and proliferation of bulge region stem cells that is most directly responsible for new anagen hair growth."

One week earlier, she spent time caring for her young niece, who was later diagnosed with head lice. Examination reveals excoriated papules, crusting, and occasional burrows on the wrists and interdigital web spaces. Despite two weeks of topical permethrin cream, her symptoms have not improved. She has no significant medical history. What is the most appropriate next-line therapy?",
    "choices": [
      "Oral fluconazole",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has persistent scabies after initial permethrin therapy. The reference describes ivermectin as a systemic antiparasitic that blocks glutamate-gated chloride channels, paralyzing the parasite. Oral ivermectin is the best next-line treatment, especially for crusted or treatment-resistant scabies as in this case. Malathion is a topical option for lice (and can be used for scabies), but it's less favored due to its flammability and cost. Antifungals, steroids, or antihistamines would not address the underlying infestation."

Features include diffuse fine scaling, erythema, alopecia, dwarfism, punctate epiphyseal calcification, respiratory compromise, and abnormal CNS development. The disease is severe and leads to progressive CNS dysfunction and early death in infancy. Unilateral ichthyosiform erythroderma is characteristic of CHILD syndrome (choice A), while asymmetric stippling, mild skeletal defects, and preserved intelligence are more aligned with autosomal dominant chondrodysplasia punctata (choice B).

Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate high-dose corticosteroids for presumed small-vessel vasculitis",
      "Begin aspirin and investigate for underlying myeloproliferative disease",
      "Start calcium channel blockers for suspected primary Raynaud's phenomenon",
      "Recommend topical capsaicin cream and wound care for ulcer prevention",
      "Advise strict cold avoidance and monitor for digital ulceration"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient\u2019s symptoms are classic for erythromelalgia\u2014episodes of burning pain, erythema, and warmth, usually triggered by heat and relieved by cooling, with negative workup for connective tissue disease. One important association is with myeloproliferative disorders, such as essential thrombocythemia or polycythemia vera. Aspirin is first-line for symptomatic relief and workup for myeloproliferative disease is recommended. Calcium channel blockers and cold avoidance are used for Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, which is not consistent with her symptom pattern. High-dose steroids are not indicated in erythromelalgia without clear evidence of vasculitis. Topical capsaicin and wound care are not first-line, as ulceration is not a prominent complication of erythromelalgia."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with multiple, asymptomatic, reddish-brown skin plaques on his trunk. Biopsy reveals a dense dermal infiltrate of large polygonal histiocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm in a background of lymphocytes and plasma cells, producing a 'starry night' appearance. Occasional whole lymphocytes are observed within the cytoplasm of histiocytes. Immunohistochemistry is positive for S100 and CD68, but negative for CD1a. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Juvenile xanthogranuloma",
      "Langerhans cell histiocytosis",
      "Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease",
      "Xanthoma disseminatum",
      "Erdheim-Chester disease"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Cutaneous Rosai-Dorfman disease is characterized by a dense dermal infiltrate of large polygonal histiocytes with abundant pale cytoplasm, prominent presence of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and the unique feature of emperipolesis (whole lymphocytes within histiocyte cytoplasm). The immunostaining profile (S100+, CD68+, CD1a-) further supports the diagnosis. Langerhans cell histiocytosis is S100+ and CD1a+, but does not show emperipolesis."

    "question": "A 58-year-old male presents with a painless, solitary erythematous nodule on his right cheek that has slowly enlarged over several months. Physical examination reveals a 2.3 cm firm, non-tender plaque without ulceration or regional lymphadenopathy. A skin biopsy shows a variably dense dermal infiltrate composed predominantly of small lymphocytes, admixed with scattered eosinophils, plasma cells, and a few histiocytes. Germinal centers are present and stain CD10 positive and bcl-2 negative. Immunohistochemistry shows a mixed population of CD20+ B cells and CD3+ T cells with a normal CD4:CD8 ratio. CD68+ histiocytes are also seen, and plasma cells demonstrate kappa and lambda light chain expression. No clonal IgH rearrangement is detected. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Primary cutaneous follicle center lymphoma",
      "Cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (pseudolymphoma)",
      "Blastic plasmacytoid dendritic cell neoplasm",
      "Extranodal NK/T cell lymphoma, nasal type",
      "Cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histopathologic features indicate cutaneous lymphoid hyperplasia (pseudolymphoma). Key clues are the mixed B and T cell infiltrate, preservation of a normal CD4:CD8 ratio, germinal centers positive for CD10 and negative for bcl-2 (which helps distinguish benign follicles from lymphoma), presence of CD68+ histiocytes, and polyclonal plasma cells. The absence of IgH clonal rearrangement also suggests a reactive rather than neoplastic process. Lymphoma variants would be expected to show clonal B cell or T cell populations, lack of normal follicular markers, or abnormal immunophenotypes."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man who recently immigrated from Brazil presents with numerous, symmetrically distributed, non-tender, hypopigmented macules and nodules on his face, trunk, and extremities. He complains of loss of sensation over several lesions. Biopsy of a nodular lesion reveals a diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate in the dermis with numerous foamy macrophages containing small, round, acid-fast bacilli on Fite stain. A narrow area of uninvolved dermis separates the infiltrate from the epidermis. There are no granulomas, but numerous collections of organisms (globi) are seen. Which of the following histopathological features would most help distinguish his disease from a tuberculoid form of the same infection?",
    "choices": [
      "Granulomatous infiltrate with few or absent organisms and well-formed granulomas",
      "Lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with numerous organisms and a grenz zone",
      "Epidermal atrophy overlying the infiltrate",
      "Presence of neutrophilic abscesses in the dermis",
      "Fibrinoid necrosis of blood vessel walls with RBC extravasation"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The described findings\u2014diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltrate, numerous acid-fast bacilli in foamy macrophages (globi), a grenz zone, and absence of granulomas\u2014are classic for lepromatous leprosy. A grenz zone (clear area between infiltrate and epidermis) and numerous organisms (with positive Fite stain) best distinguish lepromatous leprosy from tuberculoid leprosy, which has granulomatous inflammation and very few or no detectable organisms. The other options (granulomatous infiltrate, epidermal changes, abscesses, and vasculitis) do not specifically distinguish between the forms as directly as the grenz zone and the abundance of organisms."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents to the dermatology clinic with complaints of hematuria and recurrent respiratory infections over the past 3 months. He has been on immunosuppressive therapy for 2 years, including hydroxychloroquine and cyclophosphamide. On examination, there are no skin eruptions, but you note mild pallor. His recent laboratory studies show leukopenia, microscopic hematuria, and abnormal urinary cytology with atypical cells. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for his current findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Hydroxychloroquine-induced ocular toxicity leading to increased infection risk",
      "Cyclophosphamide-induced bladder carcinoma and bone marrow suppression",
      "Progression of SLE with systemic lupus nephritis and immune-mediated cytopenias",
      "Development of methotrexate-related pancytopenia and renal tubular damage",
      "Secondary infection from chronic cutaneous ulceration"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient is being treated with cyclophosphamide, which is associated with significant long-term risks, including increased incidence of bladder carcinoma due to the formation of toxic metabolites excreted in urine, as well as bone marrow suppression leading to leukopenia. Hydroxychloroquine is not associated with hematuria or bladder malignancy but can cause ocular toxicity. Methotrexate toxicity is less likely without cutaneous or hepatic findings. The clinical and laboratory findings point toward cyclophosphamide toxicity rather than SLE progression or secondary infection."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of renal transplantation presents with multiple violaceous patches and nodules on his lower extremities. Biopsy of a lesion shows a dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped cells forming slit-like vascular spaces and significant red blood cell extravasation. Immunohistochemical staining is positive for an infectious immunohistochemical marker showing virally infected cells. Which of the following markers would most likely confirm the diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "HSV",

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with immunosuppression (renal transplant) presenting with vascular-appearing lesions typical of Kaposi's sarcoma. Histology further supports this diagnosis. Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma and can be detected by immunohistochemical staining of virally infected cells, confirming the diagnosis. Other markers listed are not specific to Kaposi's sarcoma."

The lesion has been present for several years with no change. Histopathology shows basal layer hyperpigmentation with mild pigment incontinence, but no nests of melanocytes and no melanocytic atypia. Which of the following diagnoses is most consistent with these findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Melanotic macule (labial lentigo)",
      "Junctional melanocytic nevus",
      "Dysplastic nevus",
      "Lentigo maligna",
      "Pigmented basal cell carcinoma"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Melanotic macule (labial lentigo) classically presents as a well-circumscribed, pigmented lesion of the lip, characterized histologically by basal layer hyperpigmentation with pigment incontinence but no melanocytic nests, atypia, or mitotic figures. In contrast, melanocytic nevi show nests of melanocytes, and dysplastic nevus, lentigo maligna, and pigmented BCC would display other features such as atypia, nests, or dermal invasion."

    "question": "A 3-year-old boy is brought to clinic for evaluation of a congenital pigmented skin lesion on his lower back. The lesion has been present since birth and now measures approximately 22 cm in diameter, with multiple small pigmented 'satellite' nevi around it. Over the past several weeks, his parents report frequent headaches and difficulty with balance. On exam, he is alert but has mild papilledema. What is the single most important investigation to pursue at this time?",
    "choices": [
      "Skin biopsy of the main lesion to look for melanoma cells",
      "MRI of the brain and spine to assess for CNS involvement",
      "Genetic testing for familial melanoma-associated mutations",
      "Incisional biopsy of one satellite lesion",
      "Serum LDH and S100 to look for melanoma markers"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The most pressing concern in this scenario is potential neurocutaneous melanosis, a condition associated with large congenital melanocytic nevi (GCMN), especially with axial location and multiple satellite lesions. Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and neurological deficits suggest possible leptomeningeal involvement. MRI of the brain and spine is the investigation of choice to detect CNS involvement and leptomeningeal melanoma. Skin biopsy may be indicated if there is rapid change within the nevus, but in this case, neurologic symptoms are the primary concern and guide the immediate next step."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with a 2-month history of a scaly, erythematous patch with mild pruritus located between the toes of his right foot. He is a construction worker and reports that the lesion initially appeared after his socks became soaked during a heavy rain. Over-the-counter topical corticosteroids provided no improvement. On examination, there is fine scaling and mild maceration between the fourth and fifth toes, with mild erythema but no frank pustulation. KOH preparation shows branching, septate hyphae. Which antifungal is the most effective first-line oral therapy for this infection in an immunocompetent adult?",
    "choices": [
      "Griseofulvin",
      "Ketoconazole",
      "Fluconazole",
      "Terbinafine",
      "Itraconazole"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This case describes tinea pedis (interdigital dermatophytosis), confirmed by KOH prep. Oral terbinafine is the most effective first-line systemic treatment for dermatophyte infections due to its fungicidal activity and superior efficacy compared to azoles or griseofulvin. Terbinafine is especially preferred for recalcitrant or widespread infection, or when topical agents fail. Other options (azoles and griseofulvin) are alternatives but are less effective for tinea pedis."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic with a 2-month history of enlargement and thickening of several fingernails, associated with yellow discoloration and debris beneath the nail plate. He works as a dishwasher and reports that the changes began soon after he noticed scaling and maceration between his toes. Physical examination reveals thickened, dystrophic fingernails with subungual hyperkeratosis and onycholysis affecting multiple fingers, as well as interdigital scaling and erythema of the feet. There is no skin involvement elsewhere and no history of autoimmune disease. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Onycholysis secondary to lichen planus",
      "Onychogryphosis due to psoriasis",
      "Onychomycosis (tinea unguium)",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient has thickened, dystrophic nails with subungual hyperkeratosis, onycholysis, and yellow discoloration, along with tinea pedis (interdigital scaling and erythema). The chronicity and association with tinea pedis strongly suggest onychomycosis (tinea unguium) caused by dermatophyte fungi, especially in someone frequently exposed to moisture. The other choices describe distinct nail disorders but do not fit this clinical scenario as well as onychomycosis."

    "question": "A 5-year-old boy presents with recurrent, non-inflammatory blisters on his hands and feet that develop after minor trauma, such as playing or wearing new shoes. His parents note that the blisters heal without scarring, but they have noticed occasional nail dystrophy. Examination reveals a few healing blisters and mild dystrophic changes to several fingernails, but his hair appears normal. There are no mucosal lesions. Which of the following is the most likely subtype of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex",
      "Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa",
      "Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa",
      "Kindler Syndrome",
      "Epidermolysis Bullosa Acquisita"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation suggests Epidermolysis Bullosa (EB): recurrent, trauma-induced blisters with variable healing and occasional nail dystrophy, but without scarring or mucosal involvement. The key detail is that blisters are generally confined to hands and feet, heal without scarring, and are associated with mild nail dystrophy; these features are characteristic of EB Simplex, which typically affects the epidermis only and has the mildest phenotype, often without systemic involvement. Junctional and dystrophic forms feature deeper blistering, often with more severe consequences such as scarring or mucosal involvement. Kindler syndrome involves blisters at multiple levels and photosensitivity, which are not seen here. EB Acquisita is an acquired (not genetic) condition, usually occurring in adulthood."

Three weeks later, he develops new flaccid bullae on the trunk and proximal limbs that erode easily with minimal trauma. A Tzanck smear from a fresh bulla shows acantholytic cells. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin reveals intercellular IgG and C3 deposits throughout the epidermis. No palmoplantar or scalp involvement is noted. Which of the following is the most likely target of the pathogenic antibodies in this patient's disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Desmoglein 1",
      "Desmoglein 3",
      "Desmoglein 1 and Desmoglein 3",
      "Desmocollin",
      "Transglutaminase 1"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This is a case of mucocutaneous (classic) pemphigus vulgaris, which presents with painful mucosal erosions followed by flaccid cutaneous blisters that are erosive, and shows acantholysis on smear and intercellular IgG/C3 on DIF. The disease is mediated by autoantibodies against both desmoglein 3 (predominant in mucosal forms) and desmoglein 1 (with both skin and mucosal involvement). Desmoglein 1 alone is more typical for pemphigus foliaceus, while desmoglein 3 alone typically presents with mucosal-only involvement."

    "question": "A 15-year-old boy presents with complaints of heat intolerance, inability to sweat, and recurrent episodes of unexplained fever. On physical exam, he has fine, thin hair over his scalp and eyebrows, as well as brittle, irregularly shaped fingernails. His skin appears dry, and there is reduced sweating even after vigorous activity. Considering the underlying pathophysiological mechanisms, which of the following findings is most likely to be associated with this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Loss of cholinergic innervation to eccrine sweat glands",
      "Mutation in a keratin gene affecting hair and nail development",
      "Adrenergic overstimulation of eccrine sweat glands",
      "Impaired adrenergic signaling to arrector pili muscles",
      "Excessive overlap in sensory dermatome distribution"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient's clinical scenario (heat intolerance, inability to sweat, alopecia, brittle nails) is consistent with ectodermal dysplasia, specifically due to a keratin 85 mutation. This mutation affects structures of ectodermal origin, including hair and nails, leading to alopecia and nail fragility. The inability to sweat stems from defective eccrine sweat glands, which are under cholinergic innervation, but the core problem here is the developmental defect (the keratin mutation), not the innervation itself. Thus, the most accurate answer is the mutation affecting ectodermal structures. The other options either reflect innervation issues or irrelevant findings."

    "explanation": "The description is characteristic of pitted keratolysis, which presents with crater-like pits, malodor, and is commonly seen in individuals with hyperhidrosis. Corynebacterium species (along with other gram-positive bacteria such as Kytococcus and Dermatophilus) are the usual causative organisms. Dermatophyte (Trichophyton) infections present with scaling and erythema, while Candida and Pseudomonas are less likely given the clinical and laboratory findings."

On examination, she has multiple hypopigmented 'ash-leaf' macules on her trunk, several reddish-brown papules clustered on her nose and cheeks, and a firm, raised plaque on her forehead. Oral inspection reveals gingival fibromas and dental enamel pits. She has also developed periungual fibromas on several fingers since starting puberty. Which of the following additional findings is MOST likely to be present in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Palmoplantar punctate hyperkeratoses",

    "explanation": "This vignette describes classic features of tuberous sclerosis (TS): seizures, intellectual impairment, hypopigmented macules (ash leaf), facial angiofibromas, fibrous forehead plaque, gingival fibromas, dental pits, and periungual fibromas. TS is also characterized by the development of bilateral renal angiomyolipomas, which are common and can cause complications. Other choices reflect features seen in different conditions (e.g., palmoplantar keratoses in porokeratosis, strawberry hemangiomas as benign vascular tumors of infancy, Wickham striae in lichen planus, and pearl-white eyelid papules in lipoid proteinosis), not tuberous sclerosis."

She reports that previous treatments with potent topical corticosteroids and oral antihistamines have provided minimal relief. She has no evidence of systemic disease and laboratory workup is unremarkable. The patient is interested in non-systemic therapies to control her itching. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management, considering both efficacy and possible adverse effects?",
    "choices": [
      "Begin topical doxepin cream for targeted therapy, but counsel regarding possible anticholinergic side effects and sedation.",
      "Prescribe oral doxepin to maximize systemic antihistaminic action, warning about cardiotoxicity risk.",
      "Initiate topical cromolyn sodium for its mast cell stabilizing properties.",
      "Start hydroxychloroquine due to its anti-inflammatory properties in cutaneous lupus.",
      "Recommend topical testosterone to engage androgen receptors in the skin."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Topical doxepin cream is specifically indicated for pruritic disorders and neurotic excoriations due to its potent H1 and H2 antihistamine activity; however, patients should be advised about potential anticholinergic side effects and rarely, topical absorption may lead to systemic effects such as sedation. Oral doxepin, though also effective, poses addition risks (including cardiotoxicity) and is not typically first-line for isolated cutaneous pruritus. Cromolyn sodium is indicated for mastocytosis-associated diarrhea, not for pruritus. Hydroxychloroquine is effective for photosensitive dermatoses and certain granulomatous diseases, not for isolated pruritus. Topical testosterone is not relevant in this context."

Examination shows perioral crusting, tender erythema, and widespread flaccid bullae with superficial desquamation, especially at intertriginous sites. Nikolsky sign is positive. There are no mucosal lesions. A Gram stain of blister fluid is negative for bacteria. Which of the following would best help confirm the diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Skin biopsy showing full-thickness epidermal necrosis",
      "Blood culture for Staphylococcus aureus",
      "Identification of exfoliative toxin by ELISA",
      "PCR for streptococcal exotoxin genes",
      "Direct immunofluorescence for IgG at the basement membrane"

    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes Staphylococcal Scalded Skin Syndrome (SSSS), which typically presents in children with acute fever, irritability, and rapid onset of tender erythema, followed by flaccid bullae and superficial desquamation, most prominent in intertriginous areas. The syndrome is caused by Staphylococcal exfoliative toxins, which can be detected by ELISA, double immunodiffusion, or slide latex agglutination. Blood cultures and blister cultures are usually negative in children, as the skin damage is mediated by circulating toxin rather than direct bacterial invasion. Gram stain will not show organisms in blister fluid. Therefore, identification of the exfoliative toxin by ELISA is most helpful for confirming the diagnosis."

His past medical history includes atrial fibrillation, for which he takes warfarin, and he recently underwent coronary artery stenting, so he is also on clopidogrel. He is anxious about the risk of postoperative bleeding, and asks whether he should discontinue his anticoagulant and antiplatelet agents before the procedure to reduce the risk of bleeding. What is the most appropriate advice regarding his medications?",
    "choices": [
      "Discontinue both warfarin and clopidogrel one week prior to surgery to minimize bleeding risk.",
      "Continue both medications, as bleeding complications are more manageable than thrombotic complications in dermatologic surgery.",
      "Hold only the clopidogrel and continue warfarin, as antiplatelet agents have a higher risk of bleeding.",

      "Discontinue all antithrombotic therapy and resume after adequate hemostasis is achieved postoperatively."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Current consensus guidelines and a large retrospective study indicate that patients undergoing dermatologic surgery (including Mohs surgery) should continue medically necessary anticoagulant and antiplatelet medications. Bleeding complications are generally more manageable than potentially life-threatening thrombotic events that can occur with discontinuation of these agents. Therefore, both warfarin and clopidogrel should be continued in this patient. Discontinuation increases the risk of serious thrombotic complications such as stroke, myocardial infarction, and death."

Amyloid deposits are highlighted by Congo red staining, appearing orange-red on light microscopy, and demonstrating green birefringence under polarized light, which is diagnostic. PAS can be positive but is diastase-resistant, and this is a helpful supportive finding, but the green birefringence on Congo red stain is pathognomonic. Other options relate to unrelated conditions (e.g., mastocytosis or fungal infection)."

On examination, she is also noted to have flat, yellowish lesions on the flexural surfaces of her fingers, especially in the web spaces. Her past medical history is significant for severe dyslipidemia refractory to statins. Laboratory workup reveals markedly elevated total cholesterol and LDL, with low HDL. She has no signs of liver disease, and there is a family history of premature cardiovascular deaths in siblings. Which of the following is most likely underlying her dermatologic presentation?",

His physical exam reveals prominent scaling on the extensor surfaces, sparing the flexures, and mild involvement of the face. His family reports similar findings in his father. Laboratory studies show decreased levels of histidine-rich protein in the stratum corneum. Which of the following most directly explains the role of the defective protein in the pathogenesis of this patient's condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Failure of filaggrin to promote keratin filament aggregation in the cornified cell",
      "Inability of loricrin to cross-link with involucrin in the cornified envelope",

      "Absence of ceramide synthesis reducing barrier lipids in the stratum corneum",
      "Mutated desmoglein impairing desmosomal adhesion between keratinocytes"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The patient's presentation is characteristic of ichthyosis vulgaris, which is commonly due to a loss-of-function mutation in the filaggrin gene (FLG). Filaggrin is a histidine-rich protein that binds and aggregates keratin intermediate filaments in the cornified layer, cross-linking them like a glue. This process is essential for proper barrier formation and hydration. Defective filaggrin leads to impaired keratin aggregation and abnormal barrier function. Loricrin and transglutaminase-1 are important for different components of the cornified envelope but are not directly implicated here; ceramides and desmogleins are unrelated to the described pathophysiology."

Two weeks into therapy, he develops widespread, sharply demarcated, ulcerative, necrotic lesions, some covered with black eschars. He also has fever, malaise, arthritis, and reports new onset hematuria. On examination, there is no nerve thickening. Laboratory tests reveal low complement levels and proteinuria. Which of the following best explains this patient\u2019s acute dermatologic complication?",
    "choices": [
      "Lepromatous leprosy with Lucio phenomenon due to necrotizing small-vessel vasculitis",
      "Erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL) due to neutrophilic immune complex vasculitis",
      "Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction following antibiotic initiation",
      "Type I reversal reaction (upgrading reaction) with T-cell mediated inflammation",
      "Primary cutaneous tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris) from hematogenous spread"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient started leprosy treatment and subsequently developed sharply demarcated ulceronecrotic skin lesions with black eschars, fever, systemic symptoms, and renal involvement (hematuria, proteinuria, low complement). These findings are most consistent with the Lucio phenomenon, a rare necrotizing vasculitis seen in untreated or recently treated lepromatous leprosy, classically in patients from Latin America. Lucio phenomenon is characterized by widespread ulceration and necrosis due to small-vessel vasculitis, and systemic vasculitic features may occur. ENL (choice 2) tends to cause erythematous, painful nodules and constitutional symptoms but does not produce sharply demarcated necrotic ulcers with eschars. Jarisch-Herxheimer reactions (choice 3) are acute fever and malaise after antibiotic initiation in spirochetal infections, not leprosy. Type I reversal reactions (choice 4) occur in borderline leprosy and typically present with neural involvement and inflamed pre-existing lesions. Lupus vulgaris (choice 5) is a form of cutaneous tuberculosis, chronic plaque-like, and not the acute necrotizing presentation seen here."

    "question": "A 72-year-old woman with poorly controlled diabetes presents with a large, chronic, exudative ulcer on her sacrum, noted during a hospital stay. The wound bed is moist and emits moderate amounts of serous exudate; the periwound skin is beginning to show signs of maceration. Based on the properties and effects of modern wound dressings, which is the most appropriate dressing for initial management of this wound?",
    "choices": [
      "Hydrogels",
      "Alginate dressing",
      "Foam dressing",
      "Hydrocolloid dressing",
      "Hydrofilm"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Alginate dressings are most absorptive and turn exudate into gel, making them ideal for wounds with moderate to heavy exudate. This reduces the risk of maceration of periwound skin, which is already noticed in this patient. Hydrogels are better for dry wounds. Hydrocolloids, while promoting angiogenesis, can cause maceration of the surrounding skin\u2014a drawback in this scenario. Foams are absorptive but not as much as alginates. Hydrofilms are occlusive and allow gas exchange, but are not appropriate for wounds with significant exudate. Thus, alginate dressing is the best choice."

    "question": "A 68-year-old man presents with a markedly thickened, curved right great toenail that has developed a horn-like appearance over several years. He is a retired construction worker, lives alone, and admits to poor self-care due to his limited mobility from longstanding peripheral vascular disease. Examination reveals a yellowish, hypertrophic, and twisted nail plate on the right hallux, with mild surrounding erythema but no significant pain. There is no history of trauma, retinoid therapy, or constitutional symptoms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Retronychia",
      "Onychogryphosis",
      "Pachyonychia congenita",
      "Platonychia",
      "Sclerodynia"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Onychogryphosis is characterized by severe hypertrophy and deformity of the nail plate, typically manifesting as a horn-like, thickened, and twisted nail. It is most often associated with self-neglect in the elderly, particularly those with peripheral vascular disease or other predisposing factors. The scenario described specifically highlights these features and risk factors. Retronychia involves proximal ingrowth of the nail plate, platonychia refers to increased nail curvature within the long axis, pachyonychia congenita is a genetic condition affecting multiple nails, and sclerodynia presents as uniformly hard nails in systemic sclerosis."

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic seeking facial rejuvenation. She is interested in a long-lasting filler for her nasolabial folds but reports a history of severe allergic reaction to a cat scratch and positive skin tests to beef-derived products in the past. She asks about the risks and suitability of different fillers. Based on her history, which filler should be avoided, and what is the most appropriate next step?",
    "choices": [
      "Recommend collagen fillers such as Bellafill but ensure skin testing prior to injection.",
      "Suggest hyaluronic acid fillers as they are not protein-based animal products and have a low risk of allergic reaction.",
      "Use cadaveric human-derived collagen, as it carries no risk of allergy in sensitive individuals.",
      "Suggest bovine collagen fillers but skip the skin testing since her reactions were to different animal proteins.",
      "Offer porcine-derived collagen fillers as a safe alternative since they are not cross-reactive with bovine allergens."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient has a history of allergic reactions to animal-derived proteins, and positive skin tests to beef suggest a heightened risk for hypersensitivity to bovine collagen fillers\u2014including Bellafill, which contains bovine collagen along with PMMA microspheres. Hyaluronic acid (HA) fillers have a very low risk of allergic reaction and are not derived from animal proteins, making them the safest option in this context. Bovine and porcine collagen fillers can cross-react, and human-derived collagen fillers (even if obtained from cadaveric or noncadaveric sources) are not commercially available. Skin testing is essential with bovine collagen but is not a guarantee against reaction in highly sensitive individuals. Therefore, HA fillers are preferred here."

    "question": "A 73-year-old man with a history of extensive sun exposure presents with a slowly enlarging, irregularly pigmented macule on his left cheek. Dermoscopic examination is suspicious for lentigo maligna. A biopsy demonstrates broad, poorly circumscribed and asymmetric proliferation of melanocytes along the epidermal-dermal junction, extending down hair follicles, and foci of atypical melanocytes invading into the dermis as irregular nests and single cells. There is a lack of maturation with depth, atypical mitotic figures, and persistent HMB-45 immunoreactivity throughout the lesion. Which of the following histopathologic findings, if present, would most strongly support a diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma rather than another melanoma subtype?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased proliferative rate on Ki-67 immunohistochemistry",
      "Predominance of spindle-shaped melanocytes embedded within a dense fibrotic stroma",
      "Confluent pagetoid spread of atypical melanocytes within the epidermis",
      "Presence of regular, nested architecture within both the epidermis and dermis",
      "Sheets of epithelioid melanocytes with abundant cytoplasm and prominent nucleoli"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Desmoplastic melanoma is characterized by a predominance of spindle-shaped melanocytes within a sclerotic or fibrotic dermis. It often lacks a prominent in-situ (pagetoid) component, may be amelanotic, and its most distinguishing histopathologic feature is the association with desmoplastic (fibrotic) stroma. While increased proliferation, pagetoid spread, and nested architecture are more typical of other melanoma subtypes, the presence of spindle cells within a fibrotic stroma is the key clue for desmoplastic melanoma."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man presents for evaluation of multiple dark macules on his back and upper arms. He reports that he has dozens of 'moles,' some of which appear atypical with irregular borders and variegated color. His father had a malignant melanoma at age 52, and the patient undergoes annual skin checks. On examination, he has numerous compound nevi, several with mild asymmetry and irregular pigmentation. A dermoscopic photograph of one lesion taken 12 months ago is compared with today's image, and there is no appreciable change in size, color, or structure. A new digital dermoscopy system is available at your clinic. Which of the following is the most evidence-based management strategy for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Serial digital dermoscopy monitoring of select atypical nevi and continued total body skin exams",
      "Excision of all clinically and dermoscopically atypical nevi",
      "Immediate genetic testing for BRAF V600E mutation",
      "Reassurance only, as dysplastic nevi are not melanoma precursors",
      "Prophylactic excision of all nevi because of family history"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Patients with multiple atypical (dysplastic) nevi have an increased *overall* risk of melanoma, but the risk is not limited to a specific nevus or to dysplastic nevi alone. The risk of melanoma is similar in areas of normal skin, dysplastic nevi, and common nevi. Serial digital dermoscopy monitoring, paired with total body skin exams, is the most evidence-based approach for patients at increased risk for melanoma, as it allows for early detection of new or changing lesions. Excising all atypical nevi or all nevi is not warranted and carries unnecessary morbidity. Although BRAF V600E mutations are found in common nevi, dysplastic nevi, and melanoma, routine testing does not influence clinical management in this scenario. Reassurance alone is insufficient since the overall melanoma risk is elevated; periodic monitoring is necessary."

    "question": "A 56-year-old obese man with a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with progressive thickening and hardening of the skin over the posterior and lateral aspects of his neck for the past 2 years. On examination, there is diffuse, nonpitting, symmetric induration with a waxy, shiny appearance and a 'peau d\u2019orange' texture affecting the upper back and neck. He denies joint pain or preceding illness, but notes some limitation in neck movement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Morphea",

      "Scleredema (Type III, diabetic subtype)",
      "Lichen sclerosus",
      "Scleroderma (systemic sclerosis)"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical picture of chronic, diffuse, symmetric nonpitting induration with a shiny and 'peau d\u2019orange' appearance over the posterior neck and upper back in an obese diabetic male is classic for scleredema adultorum (Type III), which is strongly associated with longstanding diabetes. Unlike morphea or systemic sclerosis, scleredema commonly lacks Raynaud's, sharp demarcation, and visceral involvement. Eosinophilic fasciitis and lichen sclerosus have distinct patterns and do not typically involve the described regions with this texture or association."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to your clinic with a history of multiple, small, reddish-brown papules and macules that have appeared over his trunk and extremities since infancy. His mother reports that the lesions become swollen and intensely itchy when he is excited or after taking hot baths. She also mentions that one of the larger lesions occasionally develops a small blister. There is no history of recent infections or new medications. On examination, stroking several lesions produces localized urticaria and swelling within minutes. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Juvenile xanthogranuloma",
      "Langerhans cell histiocytosis",
      "Maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa)",
      "Solitary mastocytoma",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes a child with multiple, reddish-brown papules and macules since infancy, that urticate and swell on stroking (positive Darier sign), with occasional blistering. These features are characteristic of maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa). Solitary mastocytoma (choice 4) typically presents as a single lesion, not multiple. Juvenile xanthogranuloma and Langerhans cell histiocytosis have different morphologies and do not exhibit Darier sign. Atopic dermatitis does not urticate on stroking."

The nodules measure approximately 1\u20132 cm in diameter, display a central punctum, and some have developed surrounding erythema. He recalls frequently walking barefoot on sandy beaches and rural roads. He is otherwise healthy, with no systemic symptoms, but is concerned about the development of new lesions despite good hygiene. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cutaneous myiasis",
      "Tungiasis",
      "Plantar warts",
      "Verruga peruana",
      "Persistent insect bite reaction"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is most characteristic of tungiasis, caused by the burrowing flea Tunga penetrans. Key historical features include recent travel to endemic regions (South America, Africa), walking barefoot, and painful nodules with a central punctum, primarily on feet. Myiasis typically involves fly larvae and different clinical presentation. Plantar warts lack a central punctum and are not acutely painful or pruritic. Verruga peruana is associated with Bartonella (not this history or examination), and a persistent insect bite reaction would not have this distinctive combination of symptoms or epidemiology."

He is concerned because they have slowly increased in number over three months but are otherwise asymptomatic. On examination, the lesions are cauliflower-like but lack ulceration or induration. A shave biopsy is performed, which shows acanthotic and papillated epidermis, hyperkeratosis, hypergranulosis, and prominent koilocytic changes in the upper layers of the epidermis, but no evidence of full-thickness atypia. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Bowenoid papulosis",
      "Condyloma acuminatum",
      "Verruca vulgaris",
      "Epidermodysplasia verruciformis",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Condyloma acuminatum presents as soft, papillated, and exophytic lesions most commonly on the genital or perianal area. Histologically, these lesions show acanthosis, papillomatosis, hypergranulosis, hyperkeratosis, and koilocytic changes but lack full-thickness cytologic atypia, distinguishing them from bowenoid papulosis which has full-thickness atypia. The clinical scenario, history, and pathology findings best fit condyloma acuminatum (caused by HPV 6, 11, 16, 18)."

He complains of mild pruritus but denies systemic symptoms. He has tried various topical corticosteroid creams without improvement. His medical history is unremarkable. Examination confirms a 6 cm sharply demarcated plaque with slightly raised border, fine scale, and central clearing. No other lesions are present, and there is no regional lymphadenopathy. A potassium hydroxide (KOH) preparation from the edge of the lesion is positive for branching hyphae. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line oral treatment for this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Fluconazole",
      "Ketoconazole",
      "Griseofulvin",
      "Amphotericin B",
      "Voriconazole"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation is classic for tinea corporis (a dermatophyte infection of the body) that has failed topical corticosteroids. Oral therapy is indicated for widespread, recalcitrant, or severe cases. Griseofulvin is the traditional first-line oral agent for tinea corporis, especially in adults, due to its efficacy against dermatophytes. Terbinafine is also commonly used, but among the options listed, griseofulvin is the most appropriate. Fluconazole and other azoles (ketoconazole, voriconazole) can be used but are generally not first-line for tinea corporis, and oral ketoconazole has significant hepatotoxicity risk. Amphotericin B is reserved for severe systemic mycoses and is not appropriate for superficial dermatophyte infections."

A punch biopsy reveals a dermal proliferation of spindle-shaped and dendritic melanocytes dispersed with variable melanin, and the overlying epidermis appears uninvolved. Immunohistochemistry shows diffuse S-100 and SOX-10 positivity, but is negative for Melan-A. The lesion demonstrates minimal cytologic atypia but some extension along nerve fibers. Which immunohistochemical finding best supports the diagnosis of desmoplastic melanoma over a cellular blue nevus?",
    "choices": [
      "Diffuse HMB-45 positivity",
      "Patchy Melan-A/MART-1 nuclear staining",
      "SOX-10 nuclear positivity with negative S-100",
      "Diffuse nuclear SOX-10 with negative Melan-A/MART-1",
      "Strong cytoplasmic S-100 positivity with strong Melan-A positivity"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Desmoplastic melanoma often shows strong SOX-10 nuclear positivity, is typically negative for Melan-A (MART-1) and HMB-45, but positive for S-100. SOX-10 is more sensitive for desmoplastic melanoma than Melan-A. Cellular blue nevi usually maintain positivity for Melan-A, whereas desmoplastic melanoma loses it. Thus, SOX-10 positivity with negative Melan-A strongly favors desmoplastic melanoma over cellular blue nevus."

He denies pain, pruritus, or constitutional symptoms. There is no history of trauma or medication changes. Examination reveals well-circumscribed, non-erythematous bullae, mostly on the dorsal feet and anterior lower legs. Nikolsky's sign is negative. Direct immunofluorescence of a biopsy is negative for immune deposits, and bacterial cultures are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes spontaneous, non-inflammatory bullae in a diabetic patient, classically seen in bullosis diabeticorum. Unlike autoimmune blistering diseases (e.g., bullous pemphigoid or epidermolysis bullosa acquisita), there is no immunofluorescence evidence of immune deposits. There is also an absence of pain or systemic symptoms, making infectious causes such as cellulitis unlikely. Porphyria cutanea tarda usually presents with more fragile skin, increased pigmentation, and positive immunofluorescence. Bullosis diabeticorum is a rare but distinctive cutaneous manifestation of diabetes."

On examination, the nodule is 3 cm, firm, mobile, and non-tender with normal overlying skin. There is no regional lymphadenopathy. An excisional biopsy reveals a well-circumscribed, unencapsulated dermal tumor composed of bland spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern, admixed with scattered histiocytes, and no significant mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for factor XIIIa and negativity for CD34, S100, and desmin. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans",
      "Desmoplastic melanoma",
      "Dermatofibroma (benign fibrous histiocytoma)",
      "Atypical fibroxanthoma",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Dermatofibroma (benign fibrous histiocytoma) is characterized histologically by bland spindle cells in a storiform pattern, scattered histiocytes, and absence of significant mitoses. Immunohistochemistry is classically positive for factor XIIIa and negative for CD34 (which helps differentiate it from dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans, which is CD34 positive). Clinical presentation with a firm, mobile nodule in the dermis also fits. Other options either do not fit the clinical and histological scenario or are positive for different immunomarkers."

    "question": "A newborn presents with stark white hair, pale skin, and blue irides. The parents report that the baby\u2019s eyes are highly sensitive to light, and the pediatrician notes horizontal nystagmus and markedly decreased visual acuity. There is no evidence of pigment development over the first few months. Past medical history is unremarkable, and there is no consanguinity. Family history is negative for similar findings, but the pediatric geneticist is concerned about syndromes associated with chromosomal deletions. Which of the following best distinguishes this subtype of albinism from other forms?",
    "choices": [
      "Melanocytes are absent in affected skin.",
      "Pigment accumulates progressively with age.",
      "Tyrosinase enzyme is completely nonfunctional.",
      "Mutation occurs in the microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF) gene.",
      "There is increased risk for Hirschsprung disease and sensorineural deafness."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes type 1A oculocutaneous albinism (OCA1A), which is inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion and results from complete absence of tyrosinase activity. Melanocytes are present, but there is no pigment produced at any time. This is contrasted with OCA1B, in which there may be some progressive pigment accumulation, and other forms of hypopigmentation with different molecular etiologies. MITF mutations and associations with Hirschsprung disease and deafness are characteristic of certain Waardenburg syndromes, not classic albinism."

She reports a history of pruritus and rash when exposed to certain topical products, but no prior adverse reactions to anesthetic injections. You plan to use lidocaine with epinephrine to provide local anesthesia. After infiltration, the patient develops localized erythema and mild swelling at the injection site, without systemic symptoms. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in anesthetic management should future procedures be required?",
    "choices": [
      "Switch to an ester-type local anesthetic for future procedures",
      "Use diphenhydramine injection as the primary local anesthetic alternative",
      "Avoid epinephrine and use plain lidocaine only",
      "Test for parabens allergy and use paraben-free anesthetic if positive",
      "Refer for allergy testing for true lidocaine allergy"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Allergic contact dermatitis localized to the injection site is most likely due to parabens in the anesthetic formulation, not a true lidocaine allergy (which is rare). The most appropriate management is to use a paraben-free anesthetic if parabens allergy is suspected. Switching to an ester anesthetic is indicated only for true immunologic allergy to lidocaine, which is far less common. Alternatives such as diphenhydramine are less effective and have a slower onset. Epinephrine is unlikely to be relevant here, and allergy testing for lidocaine is reserved for systemic or severe true allergy suspicion."

Its hallmark histopathology is subcorneal pustules packed with neutrophils in the absence of acantholysis, typically occurring in middle-aged women. First-line treatment is acitretin, with other options including narrow-band UVB and dapsone. While dapsone is sometimes mentioned in older literature, acitretin is a preferred contemporary therapy because of efficacy and safety profile. Prednisone and methotrexate are not first-line, and oral antibiotics are ineffective as the pustules are sterile."

Histologically, it shows basaloid nests, desmoplastic (collagen-rich) stroma, and keratin horn cysts, with negative S100 (which helps exclude melanoma). Desmoplastic melanoma would be S100 positive and lack horn cysts, whereas basal cell carcinoma would show peripheral palisading and retraction artifact. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma can mimic this but usually presents deeper infiltrative patterns. Sclerosing adenosis is a breast pathology."

Which of the following is most accurate regarding this patient's risk of mortality?",
    "choices": [
      "His mortality risk is approximately 3%.",
      "His mortality risk is approximately 12%.",
      "His mortality risk is approximately 35%.",
      "His mortality risk is approximately 58%.",

    "question": "A 13-year-old boy presents with multiple tender, yellowish papules and nodules on his elbows, knees, and buttocks. He has a history of recurrent episodes of severe abdominal pain and early-onset pancreatitis. Laboratory investigations reveal marked elevation of fasting triglycerides and reduced levels of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). His parents report similar but milder symptoms in his younger sister. On examination, there is no hepatosplenomegaly. Which of the following disorders most likely explains his presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia (Familial Lipoprotein Lipase Deficiency)",
      "Type IIA Hyperlipoproteinemia (Familial Hypercholesterolemia)",
      "Type IIB Hyperlipoproteinemia (Familial Combined Hyperlipidemia)",
      "Type III Hyperlipoproteinemia (Familial Dysbetalipoproteinemia)",
      "Type IV Hyperlipoproteinemia (Familial Hypertriglyceridemia)"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Type I Hyperlipoproteinemia is characterized by deficiency of lipoprotein lipase (LPL), leading to markedly elevated triglycerides with low HDL, recurrent pancreatitis, and eruptive xanthomas (yellowish papules/nodules). The absence of hepatosplenomegaly and the classic clinical and laboratory findings support this diagnosis. Type IIA and IIB typically show elevated cholesterol without significant triglyceridemia. Type III presents with palmar xanthomas and premature atherosclerosis. Type IV involves hypertriglyceridemia but is less severe and rarely involves eruptive xanthomas or recurrent pancreatitis in childhood."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with diffuse scaling and erythema on her extremities. Physical examination reveals thickened plaques with silvery scale predominantly over extensor surfaces. Histopathology of a biopsy shows thickened stratum corneum with parakeratosis, absent granular cell layer, and elongation of rete ridges. Which of the following most accurately explains the formation of parakeratosis in this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased rate of keratinocyte proliferation resulting in incomplete loss of nuclei in the stratum corneum.",
      "Failure of lamellar granule exocytosis leading to poor lipid barrier formation.",
      "Defective cross-linking of loricrin within the cornified envelope.",
      "Impaired calcium gradient preventing activation of filaggrin.",
      "Excessive apoptosis of suprabasal keratinocytes causing premature terminal differentiation."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Parakeratosis refers to the retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum, which normally should be anuclear. In disorders like psoriasis, rapid keratinocyte turnover does not allow sufficient time for the normal process of nuclear loss, resulting in nucleated corneocytes at the skin surface. The other options involve different aspects of epidermal differentiation and barrier formation but do not directly result in parakeratosis."

    "question": "A 55-year-old male from rural Brazil presents with a 9-month history of progressive swelling and deformity of his right foot. He reports multiple discharging sinuses, from which yellowish granules can be seen in the pus. The area is tender, and the skin shows indurated plaques with draining sinuses. He works barefoot in agriculture. Past medical history is unremarkable. Laboratory studies are significant for normal white cell count and no systemic symptoms. A deep biopsy shows chronic granulomatous inflammation, and cultures grow aerobic branching, filamentous, Gram-positive bacteria. What is the most appropriate combination therapy for this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Oral itraconazole and terbinafine",
      "Oral penicillin and clindamycin",
      "IV amikacin and oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole",
      "IV amphotericin B and oral flucytosine",
      "Oral doxycycline and rifampicin"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes actinomycetoma, a chronic, subcutaneous infection due to aerobic filamentous bacteria, most commonly Nocardia and Actinomadura species, typically acquired from soil in rural settings. The classic triad features are tumefaction, draining sinuses, and grains. The recommended treatment is a combination of amikacin (IV) plus either dapsone or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX). Thus, IV amikacin plus oral TMP-SMX is the correct answer. Options such as antifungals (A, D) or standard antibiotics for actinomycosis (B, E) are not appropriate for actinomycetoma."

    "question": "A 34-year-old male presents with several asymptomatic hypopigmented patches on his trunk and extremities. The lesions have been slowly spreading over the past year. He denies any previous treatment or significant past medical history. On examination, the patches are well-demarcated, non-scaly, and show no signs of atrophy. A punch biopsy reveals a sparse superficial perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate, mild pigment incontinence, and minimal epidermotropism. Immunohistochemical staining demonstrates a predominance of CD8+ T-cells within the infiltrate. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Vitiligo",
      "Pityriasis alba",
      "Hypopigmented variant of mycosis fungoides",
      "Lichen planus pigmentosus",
      "Early leprosy (indeterminate type)"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes hypopigmented, well-demarcated patches with histopathology showing a superficial sparse lymphocytic infiltrate, pigment incontinence, minimal epidermotropism, and predominance of CD8+ cells. These features are characteristic of the hypopigmented CD8+ variant of mycosis fungoides (MF), particularly common in younger individuals and darker skin types. Vitiligo and pityriasis alba would lack lymphocytic infiltrate or pigment incontinence, while lichen planus pigmentosus typically has a lichenoid infiltrate. Early leprosy shows non-caseating granulomas and is not characterized by predominant CD8+ epidermotropic lymphocytes."

The lesions began in childhood and she reports a positive family history in her father and paternal grandmother. Examination reveals focal hyperkeratosis and tense bullae at sites of friction. No mucosal involvement is noted. Histopathology demonstrates intraepidermal blister formation above the basal layer. Immunofluorescence is negative for autoantibodies. Which of the following mutations is most likely responsible for this patient\u2019s condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Mutation in the KRT1 gene encoding basic keratin in suprabasal keratinocytes",
      "Mutation in the KRT14 gene encoding acidic keratin of the basal epidermal layer",
      "Deficiency of filaggrin involved in keratin aggregation",
      "Autoantibodies directed against desmoglein 3",
      "Loss of function in laminin-332 of the basement membrane"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient presents with features of epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS), a blistering disease that is usually inherited in an autosomal dominant manner, beginning in childhood with blisters at sites of friction and no mucosal involvement. EBS is caused by mutations in genes encoding cytokeratins 5 or 14 (KRT5 or KRT14), which are type II (basic) and type I (acidic) keratins, respectively, localized to the basal layer of the epidermis. These keratins form intermediate filaments that provide mechanical stability to basal keratinocytes. Mutations disrupt their function, making cells susceptible to mechanical trauma. KRT14 specifically encodes an acidic keratin of the basal layer. Other options describe defects in structures or proteins associated with different blistering or keratinization disorders."

    "question": "A full-term neonate develops a localized fluctuant swelling over the right parietal region of the scalp within a few hours after birth. The lesion does not cross the cranial suture lines and slowly enlarges over the next 48 hours. The birth was prolonged and involved use of forceps. On follow-up, the infant exhibits mild jaundice, but there are no signs of infection. Which of the following best explains the underlying process responsible for this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Subgaleal hemorrhage extending across suture lines due to birth trauma",
      "Edema of the scalp crossing suture lines caused by pressure during delivery",
      "Subperiosteal bleed confined by cranial suture lines following perinatal trauma",
      "Congenital vascular anomaly associated with persistent cutaneous marbling",
      "Phototherapy-induced skin discoloration in a jaundiced newborn"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a cephalohematoma: a subperiosteal collection of blood limited by cranial sutures and commonly associated with traumatic or assisted delivery. It may enlarge in the first days of life and is a risk for subsequent hyperbilirubinemia due to blood breakdown, but rarely becomes infected. The key features distinguishing cephalohematoma are onset shortly after birth, fluctuant lesion not crossing suture lines, and a link to difficult labor. Caput succedaneum, in contrast, is an edema of the scalp that frequently crosses suture lines. Subgaleal hemorrhage can cross suture lines and is more extensive and dangerous. Choices regarding vascular anomalies (like CMTC) or phototherapy-induced discoloration (bronze baby syndrome) do not fit the described findings."

His parents also report episodes of gum bleeding and recent loosening of several teeth. On examination, there are multiple purpuric papules and plaques involving the scalp, flexures, and perianal area. X-ray of the jaw reveals areas of alveolar bone loss and \u2018floating\u2019 teeth. A skin biopsy demonstrates dermal infiltrate of cells that are CD1a and S100 positive with characteristic comma-shaped nuclei. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Juvenile xanthogranuloma",
      "Acute lymphoblastic leukemia with gingival involvement",
      "Chronic granulomatous disease",
      "Langerhans cell histiocytosis",

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario combines scaly, crusted, often purpuric papules, oral mucosal involvement with alveolar bone loss and \u2018floating\u2019 teeth, and histology positive for CD1a and S100 with Langerhans cell morphology\u2014findings classic for Langerhans cell histiocytosis. Juvenile xanthogranuloma typically presents as yellow-orange papules in infants without characteristic bone involvement. Leukemia and CGD may involve gingiva but do not have these histological findings, and multicentric reticulohistiocytosis has a different cutaneous and systemic pattern."

He reports mild tenderness but no other symptoms. He has no personal or family history of melanoma, spends minimal time outdoors, and has no history of significant sunburns. On examination, the lesion is a 2.2 cm irregularly bordered, variegated brown-black macule located at the heel. Dermoscopy reveals a parallel ridge pattern. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Reassure the patient and advise routine monitoring at annual skin checks.",
      "Advise the patient that acral melanocytic lesions are always benign in people of color.",
      "Arrange an urgent excisional biopsy with narrow margins of the lesion.",
      "Apply topical corticosteroids and reexamine in 3 months.",
      "Perform cryotherapy to ablate the lesion, as acral lentigines are rarely malignant."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes a classic presentation of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), which is the most common subtype of melanoma in people with skin of color, often appearing on the palms, soles, or nail units. ALM is unrelated to UV exposure and frequently presents as a slowly enlarging, irregularly pigmented patch. The parallel ridge pattern on dermoscopy is highly specific for ALM. Early recognition and urgent excisional biopsy with narrow margins is critical, as delays in diagnosis commonly occur in patients with skin of color, often leading to poorer outcomes. The other options do not address the need for timely diagnostic biopsy and may contribute to delay in diagnosis."

    "question": "A 68-year-old male renal transplant recipient presents to the dermatology clinic with a rapidly growing, ulcerated lesion on his left forearm. He has a history of chronic sun exposure and is currently immunosuppressed with tacrolimus and azathioprine. Biopsy confirms the diagnosis of moderately differentiated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) with perineural invasion. Imaging reveals involvement of a single regional lymph node, but no distant metastases. Which of the following is the BEST next step in the management of his SCC considering his risk factors and current therapies?",
    "choices": [
      "Continue current immunosuppression, perform surgical excision of the lesion, and observe lymph node",
      "Switch tacrolimus and azathioprine to sirolimus, perform wide local excision and regional lymph node dissection",
      "Start platinum-based chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitor as first-line therapy, withholding surgery and radiation",
      "Refer for Mohs micrographic surgery only, without altering immunosuppressive regimen",
      "Treat with radiotherapy alone considering increased surgical risk due to immunosuppression"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient is at high risk for aggressive SCC because of his immunosuppressed state (renal transplant, calcineurin inhibitor and anti-metabolite use), high-risk histological features (perineural invasion), and regional lymph node involvement. The reference suggests switching immunosuppressive therapy from calcineurin inhibitors and anti-metabolites (tacrolimus, azathioprine) to mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus), which are associated with a lower risk of SCC and may improve outcomes. Wide local excision with regional lymph node dissection is indicated for regional metastatic SCC. Platinum-based chemotherapy and EGFR inhibitors are generally reserved for advanced, non-resectable, or metastatic disease (not first-line in potentially surgical cases). Mohs surgery may be considered in certain localized cases but not as sole therapy in the presence of nodal disease and high-risk features. Radiotherapy alone would not be adequate as definitive therapy in this scenario, especially given the nodal involvement."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with several weeks of intensely pruritic papules and pustules on his face and upper trunk. He reports a history of atopic dermatitis. On examination, there are groups of papulopustules, many of which are centered around hair follicles, some with surrounding erythema. A skin biopsy is performed. Histologically, there are aggregates of eosinophils both within the infundibula of hair follicles and dispersed in the superficial dermis. There is no significant neutrophilic infiltrate. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Bacterial folliculitis",
      "Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis",
      "Acne vulgaris",
      "Cutaneous candidiasis",
      "Eosinophilic panniculitis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Eosinophilic pustular folliculitis is characterized by aggregates of eosinophils within and around hair follicles, especially in patients with atopic background. The absence of neutrophilic predominance (as seen in bacterial folliculitis) and the folliculotropic distribution on histology distinguishes it. Eosinophilic panniculitis involves the subcutis, not primarily hair follicles. Acne is dominated by neutrophils, and candidiasis would show yeasts and often neutrophils."

She reports frequent flares characterized by pruritic, erythematous plaques with excoriation on the flexural surfaces. Her previous regimens included emollients and intermittent use of over-the-counter 1% hydrocortisone, with only mild benefit. She is concerned about the long-term risk of cutaneous atrophy and systemic effects, especially as she is planning to become pregnant. Which of the following topical drugs would be the most appropriate next step in management, given her concerns and treatment history?",
    "choices": [
      "Prescribe clobetasol propionate 0.05% ointment for up to 2 weeks",
      "Initiate topical tacrolimus 0.1% ointment twice daily to affected areas",
      "Switch to topical crisaborole 2% ointment applied twice daily",

      "Use topical betamethasone dipropionate 0.05% ointment twice daily"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Crisaborole is a topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor approved for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis and is considered steroid-sparing with minimal risk of cutaneous atrophy or systemic complications, making it a suitable option for this patient. Topical corticosteroids, while effective, carry the risk of cutaneous atrophy and, depending on potency, can have systemic absorption\u2014points of concern for the patient. Topical tacrolimus is also a steroid-sparing agent, but is generally reserved for moderate-to-severe disease and can cause burning; it is also classified as FDA Category C for pregnancy. Crisaborole provides a safer profile for long-term management of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis in this scenario."

The lesions began two weeks after she received a tattoo using ink she purchased online. There is no fever or systemic symptoms. Biopsy demonstrates granulomatous inflammation. Fungal and routine bacterial stains are negative. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of her presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Sporothrix schenckii",
      "Mycobacterium marinum",
      "Mycobacterium fortuitum complex",
      "Staphylococcus aureus",
      "Nocardia brasiliensis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Mycobacterium fortuitum complex organisms (including M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, and M. abscessus) are 'rapid-growing' mycobacteria found in soil, water, and on animals. They often cause skin and soft tissue infections after trauma, contaminated surgical instruments or tattoo ink, and can present as subcutaneous nodules, sometimes with a sporotrichoid spread. Mycobacterium marinum also presents with nodules and sporotrichoid spread, but is tied uniquely to aquatic exposure (e.g., aquariums or fish tanks). The lack of such exposure and the clear history of tattoo ink points to the rapid-growing mycobacterial infection. Sporothrix schenckii would be suspected if there was a history of gardening/plant injury. Staphylococcus aureus generally causes abscesses and cellulitis without granulomatous inflammation. Nocardia is possible in immunocompromised patients and the lesions tend to ulcerate rather than form granulomas."

    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) is associated with granular IgA deposits in the dermal papillae on direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin. Although anti-endomysial and anti-gliadin antibodies may be found in the serum of DH patients due to the underlying gluten-sensitive enteropathy, they are not diagnostic for DH. The pathognomonic finding is the IgA deposition in the skin biopsy. Therefore, option 5 is correct. The other options inaccurately describe the significance or type of antibodies involved in DH or conflate DH with other bullous diseases such as linear IgA disease or pemphigus."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with multiple, discrete, reddish-brown macules on his trunk and proximal extremities. He reports that these lesions become raised and pruritic after scratching. On examination, some lesions demonstrate a positive Darier sign (urtication with rubbing). No hepatosplenomegaly is detected. Laboratory workup is notable for a mild increase in serum tryptase. A skin biopsy shows numerous mast cells staining positively for c-Kit (CD117) and tryptase. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis underlying this patient\u2019s skin disorder?",
    "choices": [
      "Autoimmune-mediated destruction of melanocytes with secondary cytokine release",
      "Clonal proliferation of dermal mast cells driven by activating c-Kit mutation in bone-marrow-derived stem cells",
      "Exaggerated Th2 immune response with eosinophilic infiltrate and IL-5 overproduction",
      "Defective desmosomal proteins leading to intraepidermal blister formation and acantholysis",
      "Chronic ultraviolet-induced DNA damage causing abnormal keratinocyte proliferation"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient has cutaneous mastocytosis (specifically urticaria pigmentosa), which arises due to clonal proliferation of dermal mast cells derived from bone-marrow CD34+ stem cells. This proliferation is typically driven by activating mutations in the c-Kit (CD117) receptor, a receptor tyrosine kinase. These mutated mast cells store and release inflammatory mediators such as histamine, heparin, and tryptase. Autoimmune melanocyte destruction (A) describes vitiligo; Th2/Eosinophilic (C) typifies atopic dermatitis; desmosomal defects (D) are seen in pemphigus; UV-induced DNA damage (E) is a key factor in actinic keratosis and skin cancer."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with a new, irregularly pigmented lesion on his upper back. Histology from a punch biopsy shows an atypical proliferation of melanocytes within the epidermis but with possible extension into the dermis. Immunohistochemistry is performed to help distinguish between a benign nevus and a nevoid melanoma. Which of the following immunohistochemical findings would most support a diagnosis of nevoid melanoma over a benign nevus, based on the differences in marker expression and utility?",
    "choices": [
      "HMB-45 stains all melanocytes in both the epidermis and dermis uniformly.",
      "SOX-10 shows strong nuclear staining in all lesional cells, but is negative in adjacent neural structures.",
      "S-100 is negative in both the epidermal and dermal components of the lesion.",
      "HMB-45 stains melanocytes in the epidermis but loses staining in the dermal component, suggesting maturation.",
      "SOX-10 shows nuclear positivity in the spindle cell component, but this is not specific for melanoma."
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "In benign nevi, HMB-45 typically stains epidermal (junctional) melanocytes but loses expression in the dermis, reflecting maturation as cells descend (choice D). Loss of HMB-45 staining with depth is a sign of benignity. In nevoid melanoma (or melanomas with questionable maturation), maintenance of HMB-45 staining in the dermal component would be concerning for malignancy. The scenario describes loss of staining in the dermis, which favors a benign process and indicates understanding of how immunohistochemistry aids in differentiating benign from malignant lesions. SOX-10 and S-100 are highly sensitive for melanocytic lineage but are less useful for distinguishing between benign and malignant/maturing lesions."

    "question": "A 65-year-old Brazilian farmer presents with a long-standing, slowly expanding, warty plaque on the dorsal foot. The lesion is verrucous with areas of black dots and scarring. Examination reveals no regional lymphadenopathy. He first noticed a small papule years ago after working barefoot in the fields. Histopathology of a punch biopsy demonstrates pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, mixed suppurative and granulomatous inflammation, and multiple dark-brown, thick-walled sclerotic cells ('Medlar bodies'). Which organism is MOST likely responsible for this patient\u2019s disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Sporothrix schenckii",
      "Fonsecaea pedrosoi",
      "Lacazia loboi",
      "Histoplasma capsulatum",
      "Coccidioides immitis"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario suggests chromoblastomycosis, a chronic warty fungal infection common in rural workers, especially in tropical regions like Brazil. Characteristic features include verrucous plaques, 'black dots' (representing fungal elements), and slow progression. Histopathology reveals sclerotic bodies (Medlar bodies), a hallmark of chromoblastomycosis. Fonsecaea pedrosoi is the most common etiologic agent. Sporothrix schenckii causes nodular lymphangitic lesions (sporotrichosis); Lacazia loboi causes lobomycosis (keloid-like nodules); Histoplasma and Coccidioides cause deep systemic mycoses, usually not verrucous lesions with Medlar bodies."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man undergoes excision of a 1.2 cm basal cell carcinoma on his left cheek. You plan a linear closure. Which combination of surgical techniques will best optimize cosmetic outcome and minimize complications such as wound dehiscence and tissue distortion in this location?",
    "choices": [
      "Design an elliptical excision along relaxed skin tension lines (RSTLs) with a 2:1 length-to-width ratio and close using only simple interrupted epidermal sutures.",
      "Excise with a 3:1 length-to-width ratio ellipse along RSTLs, bury the dermal edges with absorbable buried vertical mattress sutures, then use superficial simple interrupted epidermal sutures.",
      "Perform a circular excision perpendicular to RSTLs; close in layers using running subcuticular (intradermal) sutures alone for the epidermis.",
      "Excise as a straight line across the cheek, regardless of RSTLs, and use a running locked suture to close the wound under tension.",
      "Use a 4:1 ellipse oriented diagonally to RSTLs, close with horizontal mattress sutures through all layers, and use adhesive strips for the epidermis."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Optimal linear repair requires excision parallel to RSTLs to minimize scar tension and optimize cosmesis. A 3:1 length-to-width ratio allows for removal of standing cutaneous cones (dog-ears) and a tension-free closure. Deep absorbable buried vertical mattress sutures approximate the dermis, close dead space, and cause eversion of the skin edges; superficial simple interrupted sutures then appose the epidermis. The use of only superficial sutures (as in option 1) does not close dead space or sufficiently relieve wound tension. Running subcuticular sutures are excellent for avoiding track marks but do not handle tension well in linear closures. Running locked sutures are reserved for wounds under tension but are less ideal without layered closure. Elliptical excision ratios greater than 3:1 (option 5) are unnecessary and can waste tissue."

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman with a history of lupus erythematosus notices increased facial erythema and burning after spending short periods outdoors. She is diligent about photoprotection and has been using a sunscreen labeled 'SPF 30' for daily facial use. She picked this product for its high SPF, but she notes it does not mention 'broad spectrum.' After discussing her concerns with her dermatologist, she is advised to switch her sunscreen for better protection. Which of the following changes is most appropriate to reduce her risk of further skin damage from ultraviolet exposure?",
    "choices": [
      "Use an SPF 15 sunscreen with 'broad spectrum' labeling.",
      "Switch to an SPF 50 product, regardless of broad spectrum labeling.",
      "Continue SPF 30, but ensure the new sunscreen is 'broad spectrum.'",
      "Switch to a product labeled 'sunblock' with any SPF rating.",
      "Use a water-resistant sunscreen labeled 'SPF 50+' but with only UVB protection."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "While a high SPF sunscreen provides protection against UVB, only sunscreens labeled 'broad spectrum' offer protection against both UVB and UVA (which is important for patients with lupus, who are photosensitive to both). The key regulatory requirement is that only 'broad spectrum' sunscreens with at least SPF 15 can claim to reduce skin cancer risk and photoaging. Therefore, using an SPF 30 sunscreen that is also labeled 'broad spectrum' gives her significant protection against both UVA and UVB. Merely increasing SPF without UVA coverage, relying on misleading terms like 'sunblock,' or choosing a water-resistant formula without UVA coverage does not address her need for full-spectrum protection."

    "question": "A 55-year-old male with a 10-year history of chronic plaque psoriasis develops new-onset severe, recalcitrant disease despite topical and phototherapy treatments. He has a history of hypertension and chronic hepatitis B (HBV) infection. After consideration of systemic therapy, he is started on a medication that subsequently leads to rapid improvement in his psoriasis. Two months later, he presents with malaise and elevated liver transaminases. Which of the following agents is most likely responsible for his current presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Methotrexate",
      "Azathioprine",
      "Cyclophosphamide",
      "Mycophenolate mofetil (MMF)",
      "Hydroxyurea"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Methotrexate is a cytotoxic agent frequently used for severe psoriasis but can cause hepatotoxicity, especially in patients with preexisting liver disease or chronic viral hepatitis (such as hepatitis B infection). This patient's history of hepatitis B and the onset of elevated liver enzymes after methotrexate therapy strongly suggest methotrexate-induced hepatotoxicity. While other cytotoxic agents listed can also have hepatic effects, methotrexate is most classically associated with liver toxicity in dermatologic practice, particularly in the context of psoriasis management."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents with multiple painless, dome-shaped, pearly papules located predominantly on the face and neck. He also mentions that his father had a history of spontaneous pneumothorax. On examination, there are several flesh-colored papules on the cheeks and scalp, some of which have central umbilication. Several small white papules are also noted on the oral mucosa. An abdominal ultrasound reveals multiple cystic lesions in both kidneys. Which of the following genetic syndromes best explains his cutaneous and systemic findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Gardner Syndrome",
      "Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 Syndrome",

    "explanation": "Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 Syndrome is characterized by benign cutaneous lesions such as fibrofolliculomas and trichodiscomas, often located on the face, neck, and upper trunk. The syndrome is also associated with an increased risk of pulmonary cysts and spontaneous pneumothorax, as well as renal tumors (cystic or solid). The family history of pneumothorax and the presence of renal cysts support this diagnosis. Gardner syndrome presents with epidermoid cysts and GI polyps, Peutz-Jeghers with perioral lentigines and GI polyps, PTEN syndrome with trichilemmomas and mucocutaneous lesions but different internal tumors, and MEN2b with mucosal neuromas but lacks the described cutaneous papules and renal involvement."

He has generalized acanthosis nigricans, increased body hair, and prominent musculature with enlarged genitalia. His parents report he eats excessively, perspires heavily, and is heat-intolerant, despite normal growth and development. Physical exam reveals a near-total absence of subcutaneous fat and generalized hyperpigmentation without any signs of CNS involvement. Laboratory studies demonstrate elevated fasting glucose and hypertriglyceridemia. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Congenital generalized lipodystrophy (Berardinelli-Seip syndrome)",
      "Tay-Sachs disease, Juvenile type",
      "Gaucher disease type 1",

These patients also have voracious appetite, hyperhidrosis, and metabolic derangements (elevated glucose and triglycerides). There is often sparing of the CNS, which helps distinguish it from lysosomal storage diseases such as Tay-Sachs and Niemann-Pick, which have prominent CNS findings. Gaucher and Fabry disease typically present with other organ-specific features rather than the constellation seen here."

    "question": "A 67-year-old woman with a history of poorly controlled diabetes presents with a chronic scaly, erythematous plaque on her left lower leg that has been unresponsive to emollients. Her dermatologist prescribes a high-potency topical corticosteroid ointment, but at follow-up, the patient reports little improvement. On review of her application technique, you find she applies a thin layer over a large surface area and covers it with a dry gauze daily. None of her other medications or medical history have changed. Biopsy rules out infection and reveals epidermal atrophy but no evidence of vasculitis or lichenoid inflammation. What is the MOST likely reason for the poor therapeutic response in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "The patient's diabetes reduces her skin's ability to absorb topical steroids.",
      "Ointment is less effective than creams for this indication.",
      "Dry gauze does not provide an optimal vehicle for corticosteroid absorption.",
      "A larger surface area leads to reduced systemic absorption of steroids.",
      "The potency of the topical corticosteroid is insufficient for lower leg lesions."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Dry gauze covering does not provide occlusion, which significantly increases the absorption and efficacy of topical corticosteroids. Vehicles and application technique can greatly influence efficacy: ointments enhance penetration compared to creams, and occlusion (for example, with plastic wrap) further increases absorption. Using dry gauze is not occlusive and thus does not maximize drug absorption through the skin. The other options are incorrect: diabetes does not directly impair steroid absorption; ointments are usually more effective than creams; applying to a large area increases, not decreases, systemic absorption; and a high-potency steroid would generally be sufficient for lower leg plaques if absorption is optimized."

    "question": "A 19-year-old woman presents with a several-month history of moderate inflammatory papulopustular acne involving the face and upper trunk. She has failed topical retinoids and benzoyl peroxide, and has mild GI symptoms with prior minocycline use. She is sexually active but not considering pregnancy at this time and requests an oral medication with a favorable side effect profile. Which of the following would be the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate oral doxycycline 100 mg BID",
      "Start oral sarecycline 1.5 mg/kg/day",
      "Begin oral isotretinoin",
      "Prescribe oral erythromycin",
      "Advise oral clindamycin"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Oral sarecycline is a narrow-spectrum tetracycline designed for moderate to severe inflammatory acne and is effective at a dose of 1.5 mg/kg/day, as demonstrated in the referenced phase 3 trials. It has a more favorable GI side effect and antimicrobial resistance profile compared to broad-spectrum tetracyclines like doxycycline and minocycline. Isotretinoin is reserved for severe or recalcitrant cases, and oral antibiotics like erythromycin and clindamycin have more GI side effects and higher resistance risk. Sarecycline is supported by evidence and guidelines as appropriate for this moderate case with prior tetracycline intolerance."

He also notes two similar lesions on the left leg. He denies fever, cough, or systemic symptoms. Examination reveals grouped ulcerated nodules with undermined bluish-red edges on the right forearm and a few nontender subcutaneous nodules on the leg, but no lymphadenopathy. He has a history of pulmonary tuberculosis ten years ago, for which he was treated. A skin biopsy shows caseating granulomas, and PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis is positive. What is the most likely form of cutaneous tuberculosis in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Lupus vulgaris",
      "Scrofuloderma",
      "Tuberculous gumma (metastatic tuberculous abscess)",
      "Tuberculid (erythema induratum)",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient's presentation (multiple, painless, ulcerated nodules, positive TB PCR, history of TB, no lymphadenopathy, caseating granulomas, origin from a TB-endemic area) is most consistent with tuberculous gumma, also known as metastatic tuberculous abscess. This form occurs due to hematogenous spread from a previous focus, typically seen in adults with lowered immunity or a distant history of TB. Lupus vulgaris represents a chronic progressive plaque, usually in immunocompetent individuals. Scrofuloderma arises from contiguous spread from underlying infected lymph nodes or bone and typically involves regional lymphadenopathy. Erythema induratum and papulonecrotic tuberculid are considered hypersensitivity reactions (tuberculids) and rarely yield positive TB PCR from skin lesions."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A structural measure assesses an aspect of the healthcare system or infrastructure supporting care delivery, such as having systems in place to track required labs. The 95% lab monitoring rate reflects the effectiveness of a structural component (the log system) ensuring care standards. It is not a process measure, which would usually assess specific clinician actions (e.g., percentage of patients actually receiving a screening). Patient-reported and outcome measures focus on patient experiences and health status, while cost measures relate to resources expended."

On examination, an eschar is seen over the palate and there is decreased sensation in the region supplied by the right ophthalmic nerve. Biopsy reveals broad, non-septate hyphae invading the blood vessels. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",
    "choices": [
      "Aspergillus fumigatus",
      "Cryptococcus neoformans",
      "Histoplasma capsulatum",

The presence of necrotic ulceration (eschar), rapid tissue destruction, cranial nerve involvement, and histological demonstration of broad, ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae invading blood vessels point strongly toward Mucor species (mucormycosis). Aspergillus typically has acute-angle branching, septate hyphae, and cryptococcus and histoplasma do not demonstrate this morphology or presentation. Pneumocystis primarily affects the lungs."

He has a personal history of multiple atypical nevi and a family history of melanoma in his father. On exam, you observe a 7 mm macule with irregular borders, uneven pigmentation, and mild erythema. Dermoscopy reveals asymmetry, an atypical pigment network, and irregular dots. A biopsy confirms architectural disorder of the nevus with cytologic atypia and sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. BRAF V600E mutation is absent. According to current evidence and guidelines on dysplastic nevi, what is the most appropriate next step in management for this lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Re-excise the lesion with 5 mm margins to ensure complete removal due to melanoma risk.",
      "Recommend total body skin photography and 3-month follow-up without further excision.",
      "No further treatment is needed, as dysplastic nevi with moderate atypia and negative margins do not warrant re-excision.",
      "Initiate referral for genetic counseling and testing for CDKN2A mutations.",
      "Begin topical imiquimod therapy to reduce recurrence risk."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Current evidence-based guidelines recommend against routine re-excision of dysplastic nevi with moderate atypia when biopsy shows negative margins. Further treatment is not needed in this scenario, and instead, patients should undergo routine surveillance. Extensive excision or therapies such as imiquimod are not indicated. While patients with a strong family history of melanoma may warrant genetic counseling, the management of a single, completely excised dysplastic nevus with moderate atypia does not require this step by itself. Total body skin photography may be helpful for ongoing monitoring but does not replace the decision to forgo further excision when margins are clear."

He describes an immediate burning and stinging sensation at the time of exposure. He denies any similar prior episodes, has no history of atopy, and reports no new foods or medications. Examination shows urticarial plaques with linear distribution and tiny embedded hair-like structures. What is the most likely pathogenic mechanism involved in this patient\u2019s cutaneous eruption?",

      "Delayed-type hypersensitivity to plant allergens",
      "Mechanical breakdown of the skin barrier leading to irritant dermatitis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario is characteristic of urticarial lesions following exposure to stinging nettle (Urtica dioica). The urticaria develops within minutes and is not mediated by prior sensitization or IgE, but rather by the direct injection of mediators (histamine, acetylcholine, serotonin) from the hollow trichomes of the plant. Hence, the correct mechanism is a direct toxic effect, not immunologic hypersensitivity."

    "explanation": "This patient presents with a solitary hypopigmented, anesthetic plaque and nerve involvement, compatible with indeterminate leprosy\u2014the earliest and least specific form. Indeterminate leprosy is characterized by a solitary lesion with or without sensory impairment and may progress to any other form of leprosy (tuberculoid, lepromatous, or borderline) depending on host immune response. Tuberculoid and lepromatous leprosy are polar forms and do not evolve into each other. Borderline leprosy may shift within the borderline spectrum, but not directly to polar forms. His presentation fits indeterminate leprosy, so Option 2 is correct."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man with essential thrombocythemia is seen in clinic for a 4-month history of painful, non-healing ulcers on the malleolar regions of both legs. He reports new ulcers develop at sites of minor trauma, and older ones persist with little improvement despite wound care and compression therapy. He is currently managed with hydroxyurea, which was initiated 18 months ago. On exam, there are multiple punched-out ulcers with violaceous, undermined borders and surrounding retiform purpura. Laboratory tests show stable blood counts and no evidence of infection. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Continue hydroxyurea and escalate local wound care",
      "Switch hydroxyurea to anagrelide for cytoreduction",
      "Add systemic corticosteroids for possible pyoderma gangrenosum",
      "Initiate empiric intravenous antibiotics for presumed infection",
      "Debride ulcers surgically and start low molecular weight heparin"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Hydroxyurea-induced leg ulceration is a well-documented adverse reaction, particularly in long-term use for myeloproliferative disorders. The characteristic ulcers are painful, have poor healing, and often occur at areas of trauma. Discontinuation of hydroxyurea is necessary, as wound care alone will not result in healing and the ulcers typically improve only after stopping the drug. Switching to an alternative agent such as anagrelide is appropriate for ongoing cytoreduction. There is no evidence of infection or pyoderma gangrenosum, and surgical debridement is not indicated. Continuing hydroxyurea will perpetuate the problem."

    "question": "A 67-year-old woman presents with a slowly enlarging, painless nodule on her scalp. On examination, there is a 1.5 cm firm, well-circumscribed, non-ulcerated nodule in the dermis. A biopsy reveals a dermal neoplasm composed of islands of basaloid cells arranged in a jigsaw (mosaic) pattern, separated by thick bands of pink hyaline basement membrane material. No significant cytologic atypia is seen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Hidradenoma (poroid, nodular)",
      "Spiradenoma",
      "Mixed tumor (chondroid syringoma)",
      "Cylindroma",
      "Dermal duct tumor (dermal poroma)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The classic histologic description of 'islands of basaloid cells in a jigsaw (mosaic) pattern, surrounded by pink hyaline basement membrane material' is diagnostic of cylindroma. Cylindromas are dermal neoplasms often seen on the scalp and are associated with Brooke-Spiegler syndrome. They are distinguished from other sweat gland tumors by this unique arrangement. Hidradenoma and poromas typically do not have this pattern; chondroid syringoma has both epithelial and mesenchymal (cartilage) elements, and spiradenoma presents as well-circumscribed painful nodules but has distinct histology with more prominent lymphoid aggregates and not the classic jigsaw pattern."

On examination, he is noted to have synophrys (unibrow), long and thick eyelashes (trichomegaly), and hypertrichosis on the forearms. He also has growth retardation, limb abnormalities, intellectual disability, and a small upturned nose. His mother mentions that his eyelashes appear especially long compared to his siblings. Which of the following genetic syndromes is most likely responsible for this constellation of findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Rubinstein-Taybi syndrome",

On examination, there are violaceous, indurated plaques with areas of hypopigmentation, atrophy, and telangiectasia over the trunk and proximal limbs. Oral mucosa is involved, with reticulated white patches. Physical exam also reveals reduced range of motion at the shoulders due to skin tightness, but no evidence of acute infection. Which of the following is the most likely underlying pathophysiological process responsible for his cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Autoantibody-mediated injury leading to subepidermal blistering",
      "Ischemic damage due to thrombosis of dermal vessels",
      "Fibrosis secondary to dysregulated adaptive immunity following donor-recipient HLA mismatch",
      "Direct cytotoxic damage to melanocytes by conditioning chemotherapy",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient presents with classic features of chronic cutaneous graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) following hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, which are characterized by poikiloderma (hypopigmentation, telangiectasia, atrophy), lichenoid and sclerodermoid changes (deep sclerosis and morphea-like plaques), and mucosal involvement. The primary pathophysiological mechanism involves a triphasic process: initial tissue injury and inflammation, followed by dysregulated B and T-cell (adaptive) immunity, especially in the setting of HLA mismatch, which ultimately results in fibrosis. This immune dysregulation and resultant fibrosis account for the sclerotic and lichenoid skin findings seen in chronic GVHD. The other answer choices do not fit the clinical scenario or underlying mechanisms described for chronic GVHD."

He has been taking chlorpromazine for over a decade. On examination, there are slate-gray to purple-gray patches over his cheeks, nose, and the dorsal aspects of his hands. There is no evidence of new medications or occupational exposures. His ophthalmological exam reveals bilateral corneal opacities, but no visual loss. A skin biopsy shows pigment granules within dermal macrophages, which stain positively with periodic acid\u2013Schiff (PAS). Electron microscopy demonstrates membrane-bound structures resembling lysosomes. Which of the following is the most likely pathogenesis of his cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Direct melanocyte stimulation by drug metabolites causing increased melanin synthesis",
      "Deposition of lipofuscin-like pigment in dermal macrophages induced by the medication",
      "Chelation of heavy metals leading to dermal deposition of metal-sulfide complexes",
      "Fixed drug eruption with interface dermatitis causing post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation",
      "Chronic arsenic exposure leading to truncal hyperpigmentation with raindrop hypopigmentation"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient is experiencing drug-induced cutaneous hyperpigmentation as a result of chronic chlorpromazine use, which is characterized by purple-gray pigmentation in sun-exposed areas and corneal involvement. Histologically, chlorpromazine-induced pigmentation shows PAS-positive lipofuscin-like pigment in dermal macrophages, a form of 'drug-induced lipofuscinosis.' Electron microscopy reveals membrane-bound lysosomal structures within these macrophages, confirming the deposition of drug-induced pigment, not an increase in true melanin, metal chelation, or post-inflammatory processes."

He spends significant time outdoors due to his occupation as a landscaper. Physical examination reveals a 1.2 cm dome-shaped, translucent nodule with telangiectasias and focal crusting. No regional lymphadenopathy is detected. A shave biopsy is performed; histopathology shows nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading and retraction artifact. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Electrodessication and curettage of the lesion",
      "Imiquimod topical cream application",
      "Mohs micrographic surgery for complete excision",

      "Radiation therapy to the area"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical scenario and histopathology are classic for basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in an immunosuppressed host (post-renal transplant). Given the location on the face and the tumor's size and high-risk features (immunosuppression and potential for aggressive growth), Mohs micrographic surgery is the most appropriate management. This tissue-sparing technique provides high cure rates and maximal preservation of normal tissue\u2014critical for facial lesions. Other options are less optimal: electrodessication and curettage or topical imiquimod are not appropriate for high-risk or facial lesions; systemic chemotherapy is reserved for metastatic cases (rare in BCC); radiation may be used if surgery is not feasible but is not first-line in this scenario."

He complains of new painless, thin, wrinkled skin in areas of application, as well as reddish-purple linear streaks. Examination reveals atrophic plaques and striae at the sites of steroid use. He is otherwise healthy and reports adherence to the regimen as previously prescribed. Which of the following interventions is MOST appropriate to minimize further cutaneous adverse effects while continuing necessary steroid treatment?",
    "choices": [
      "Switch to a more potent steroid, but reduce frequency to once daily",
      "Switch to a lower potency topical corticosteroid and limit duration of use",
      "Continue current regimen but add emollients to the affected areas",
      "Increase the frequency to twice daily to speed up response",
      "Alternate daily dosing with a systemic corticosteroid instead of topical"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient is demonstrating characteristic local adverse effects of topical corticosteroid overuse: skin atrophy and striae. These effects are most pronounced with potent formulations, prolonged use, and application to thin-skinned or intertriginous areas. Minimizing potency, using the lowest effective strength, and limiting duration reduce risk. Adding emollients or switching frequency does not alleviate the underlying risk if high potency is maintained. Systemic corticosteroids are only indicated for severe disease and carry their own adverse effect profile; alternate-day systemic dosing does not improve local cutaneous side effect risk from topical steroids."

His father and sister have experienced similar episodes. Lab evaluation shows low C4 and normal C1q; C1 esterase inhibitor levels are decreased. Which of the following is the most appropriate chronic prophylactic treatment to reduce the frequency and severity of his attacks?",
    "choices": [
      "Daily oral corticosteroids",

    "explanation": "This patient has hereditary angioedema, characterized by recurrent angioedema without urticaria, low C4, and decreased C1 esterase inhibitor. The most appropriate chronic prophylaxis is with synthetic androgens such as stanozolol or danazol, which increase hepatic production of C1 esterase inhibitor. Beremagene geperpavec is used for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, corticosteroids are not effective for hereditary angioedema, finasteride is not used in this setting, and colchicine is used for conditions like Beh\u00e7et's or familial Mediterranean fever."

On examination, the lesion is 4 cm in diameter, reddish-brown, indurated, and fixed to the overlying skin, but freely mobile over deeper structures. Incisional biopsy reveals monomorphic spindle cells arranged in a storiform pattern and infiltration into the subcutaneous fat, resulting in a honeycomb appearance. Immunohistochemistry is positive for CD34 and negative for S-100 protein. Which of the following genetic mechanisms is most likely responsible for the pathogenesis of his neoplasm?",
    "choices": [
      "Mutation in the p53 tumor suppressor gene",
      "Activating mutation in the BRAF gene",
      "Translocation resulting in COL1A1-PDGFB gene fusion",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is associated with a translocation, most commonly t(17;22), resulting in fusion of the COL1A1 gene with the PDGFB gene, leading to autocrine PDGF signaling that drives tumor growth. This genetic event is present in over 90% of cases. DFSP typically displays storiform spindle cell proliferation, honeycomb infiltration of fat, and is CD34 positive and S-100 negative. The other genetic mechanisms are characteristic of different tumors."

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes classic lichen planus: violaceous, flat-topped papules, pruritus, and Wickham striae, with a predilection for flexor surfaces, wrists, and truncal involvement in darker skin types. The pathogenesis of lichen planus involves CD8+ cytotoxic T-cell\u2013mediated injury to basal keratinocytes (the primary target), resulting in apoptosis and the classic histological findings of a band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermoepidermal junction (interface dermatitis).

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a solitary, persistent nodule with strong CD30 expression (>75%), and negative EMA and ALK, most typical of primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL). LyP type C can resemble PC-ALCL histologically (also CD30+) but usually presents with recurrent, self-healing crops of papules/nodules, rather than a solitary persistent lesion. MF with large cell transformation may occasionally show CD30+ cells, but not in the majority, and more likely presents with epidermotropism and a history of longstanding plaques/patches. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma is unlikely given the clinical location and the lack of angiocentricity. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, NOS, would be less likely without further phenotypic features and is much rarer as a solitary skin lesion."

    "question": "A full-term newborn presents with multiple, firm, blue-purple papules and nodules scattered across the trunk and extremities at birth. There is mild hepatosplenomegaly, but no significant respiratory distress. Ophthalmologic examination reveals chorioretinitis, and hearing assessment shows sensorineural hearing loss. The infant had no complications during delivery, and there is no reported maternal illness during pregnancy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Congenital rubella syndrome",
      "Congenital herpes simplex virus infection",
      "Congenital syphilis",
      "Neonatal lupus erythematosus",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The described lesions (\u201cblueberry muffin\u201d or \u201ccranberry muffin\u201d lesions) are caused by dermal extramedullary hematopoiesis. These, along with hepatosplenomegaly, chorioretinitis, and sensorineural hearing loss, are classic for congenital rubella syndrome. Hearing loss and eye findings are prominent features of congenital rubella, which is most severe when contracted in the first trimester. Congenital HSV often presents with vesicles and neurologic sequelae; congenital varicella causes cicatricial (scarred) skin lesions and limb hypoplasia; neonatal lupus causes annular erythematous lesions and systemic findings; and congenital syphilis causes bullous or maculopapular rashes, usually affecting palms and soles."

    "question": "A 54-year-old woman presents with several months of muscle weakness, primarily affecting her shoulders and thighs, as well as swelling and pain in these areas. She also reports progressive difficulty swallowing and has recently developed a persistent dry cough. Her past medical history is notable for well-controlled hypertension. On examination, she has periorbital edema with a violaceous rash and discrete erythematous papules over the dorsal aspects of her metacarpophalangeal and interphalangeal joints. Laboratory studies reveal elevated creatine kinase. Which additional finding would most strongly indicate a need for malignancy screening in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Presence of anti-Jo-1 antibodies on serology",
      "Development of interstitial lung disease",
      "Onset of symptoms in the 5th or 6th decade of life",

      "Association with sclerodermatous skin changes and anti-Ku antibodies"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The onset of dermatomyositis symptoms in the 5th or 6th decade of life is associated with a significantly increased risk of underlying malignancy, particularly in women. While anti-Jo-1 antibodies and interstitial lung disease reflect increased pulmonary involvement, and sclerodermatous changes or amyopathic forms are important subtypes, the correlation with occult malignancy is strongest with age at onset in late middle age, necessitating age-appropriate cancer screenings."

The first-line treatment is topical antiperspirants containing 6.25% to 20% aluminum chloride, typically applied at night. Systemic medications and invasive options like oral glycopyrrolate or surgical sympathectomy are reserved for refractory cases. Microwave thermolysis is primarily used for axillary (underarm) hyperhidrosis, not palmar and plantar disease. Corticosteroids are not indicated for hyperhidrosis."

He reports recurrent fever and malaise. On examination, there are multiple angiomatous, friable papules and nodules over the upper limbs and face with scattered ulcerations. He recently recovered from a prolonged febrile illness characterized by anemia. Biopsy of a papule reveals lobular proliferation of capillaries and a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, but stains for fungi and mycobacteria are negative. What is the most likely causative organism?",
    "choices": [
      "Bartonella bacilliformis",
      "Bartonella henselae",
      "Staphylococcus aureus",
      "Bacillus anthracis",
      "Borrelia burgdorferi"

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes the biphasic illness caused by Bartonella bacilliformis, endemic to South America. The acute phase, Oroya fever, presents with fever and anemia; the chronic phase, verruga peruana, features angiomatous nodules. Cultures and stains may be non-diagnostic, but the clinical\u2013epidemiologic context and histopathology point toward B. bacilliformis. Bartonella henselae and Staphylococcus aureus can cause vascular proliferations, but neither fits the patient's geography and clinical progression. Bacillus anthracis presents with black eschars, and Borrelia burgdorferi is associated with Lyme disease, not these findings."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with a 3-month history of patchy hair loss primarily involving the scalp. She denies pain, pruritus, or systemic symptoms. Her medical history is unremarkable. Examination reveals sharply demarcated, round areas of nonscarring alopecia with prominent 'yellow dots' on dermoscopy; no scaling or erythema is observed. A scalp biopsy demonstrates a markedly increased telogen count, peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrates described as 'swarm of bees,' and some evidence of follicular miniaturization. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Telogen effluvium",

    "explanation": "The best answer is Alopecia areata. Key histopathologic features include peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrates ('swarm of bees'), increased telogen count, and follicular miniaturization, all of which are described in the case. Telogen effluvium shows an elevated telogen count but lacks the peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate. Androgenetic alopecia is characterized mainly by marked miniaturization without the 'swarm of bees.' Syphilitic alopecia shows peribulbar plasma cells and positive serological tests. Psoriatic alopecia demonstrates atrophic sebaceous glands and psoriasiform hyperplasia."

On direct immunofluorescence, there is IgG and C3 deposition in the intercellular spaces of the epidermis and along the basement membrane. Indirect immunofluorescence using rat bladder is positive. Immunoprecipitation reveals reactivity with desmoplakin, envoplakin, periplakin, and BPAg1. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of this patient's disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Autoantibodies against desmoglein 3 and 1 in the skin and mucosa",
      "Autoantibodies targeting multiple plakin family antigens leading to suprabasal acantholysis",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario is classic for paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP), which commonly occurs in patients with lymphoproliferative disorders and features mucocutaneous blisters, erosions, and a polymorphous eruption. Autoantibodies in PNP target multiple proteins in the plakin family (desmoplakin, envoplakin, periplakin, BPAg1, plectin), resulting in suprabasal acantholysis. Positive rat bladder indirect immunofluorescence is characteristic of PNP. The other answer choices either describe different bullous diseases or incorrect immunologic targets."

Over the past few years, she has developed multiple smooth, firm, reddish-brown papules and nodules clustered on her upper arms and back. She reports that her mother and maternal uncle had similar skin lesions. On examination, you note the presence of more than 20 such papules in a segmental and scatter pattern. She denies seizures, visual changes, or new masses. Which of the following would be the most important next step in the management of this patient?",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes multiple cutaneous leiomyomas in a familial pattern, which is characteristic of Familial Multiple Cutaneous Leiomyomatosis (Reed Syndrome). This syndrome is associated with an increased risk for uterine and, particularly, renal cell carcinoma due to mutations in the fumarate hydratase (FH) gene. Therefore, the most important next step is to screen for renal cell carcinoma with abdominal imaging. Other options are more appropriate for conditions such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome (option 2), immunodeficiency syndromes (option 3), phakomatoses (option 4), or mastocytosis (option 5)."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with discolored, thickened, and brittle toenails that have failed to improve after several months of topical antifungal therapy. He is otherwise healthy but reports mild, chronic dyspepsia. Laboratory testing reveals mildly elevated transaminases. The dermatologist considers systemic antifungal treatment for his onychomycosis. Which of the following agents is most appropriate in this scenario, given his underlying hepatic function and clinical presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Terbinafine",
      "Itraconazole",
      "Griseofulvin",
      "Fluconazole",
      "Amphotericin B"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Terbinafine is fungicidal and effective for dermatophyte onychomycosis, but it is extensively metabolized in the liver and elimination is slowed by about 30% in those with hepatic dysfunction, risking increased toxicity. Itraconazole is also metabolized by the liver and has significant interactions, but of the two, it is sometimes preferred in mild to moderate liver dysfunction for short courses, particularly because it is not as extensively transformed for elimination as terbinafine, and it does not generally induce significant hepatic injury at typical doses. Griseofulvin is hepatically metabolized and is less effective for toenail onychomycosis. Fluconazole and amphotericin B are not first-line for dermatophyte onychomycosis; amphotericin B is not used for dermatophyte infections. In someone with underlying hepatic dysfunction, careful dosing and monitoring of itraconazole is warranted and often considered over terbinafine if there are concerns regarding liver metabolism."

Dermatological examination reveals diffuse palmoplantar keratoderma and a history of minor traumatic blisters. Histology of a punch biopsy from the plantar skin demonstrates abnormal epidermal cell cohesion involving the desmosomal plaque. Which protein is most likely deficient or mutated in this patient's disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Desmoglein I",
      "Plakoglobin",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes Naxos syndrome, which is characterized by woolly hair, palmoplantar keratoderma, and arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Naxos syndrome is associated with mutations in the plakoglobin protein, a component of the desmosomal plaque. This distinguishes it from Carvajal syndrome, which is due to desmoplakin mutations. Plakoglobin deficiency affects both skin and cardiac tissue, resulting in the described clinical features."

    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with several months of intense, generalized pruritus without any visible rash. He reports no new medications, but his review of systems is notable for mild early satiety and intermittent epigastric discomfort. His father died of gastric cancer. Past medical history is significant for hypertension, controlled on amlodipine. On exam, there are no primary skin lesions, but excoriations are scattered across the trunk and extremities. Initial laboratory investigations reveal a mild normocytic anemia, elevated ESR, and increased LDH; liver and renal function tests are normal. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate a course of oral antihistamines and monitor for symptom improvement.",
      "Begin topical corticosteroids and refer to psychiatry for possible psychogenic pruritus.",
      "Obtain a thorough hematologic and gastrointestinal evaluation, including imaging and possible endoscopy.",
      "Prescribe phototherapy and emollients for symptomatic management.",
      "Switch antihypertensive to another class and monitor for resolution."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Generalized pruritus without a rash, especially in an older adult with subtle systemic symptoms and laboratory abnormalities (anemia, elevated ESR and LDH), raises concern for an underlying systemic disease, most notably hematologic malignancies such as lymphoma or leukemia, and also gastric cancer. There is a well-documented association between paraneoplastic pruritus and both hematologic and solid-organ malignancies, particularly gastric cancer. Therefore, the next step should be a comprehensive workup for these possible underlying conditions, rather than focusing solely on symptomatic treatment."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This scenario is characteristic of Blue Rubber Bleb Nevus Syndrome (Bean syndrome), which presents with multiple compressible venous malformations in the skin and often similar lesions in the gastrointestinal tract. Chronic GI bleeding leads to anemia, and intussusception is a well-described complication due to GI venous malformations. None of the other options (pneumothorax, intra-abdominal soft tissue masses with calcifications, non-healing ulcers, or lymphatic leakage) are typical of this syndrome."

Dermoscopically, it has no horn pseudocysts. Biopsy reveals endophytic proliferation of squamous epithelium with numerous squamous eddies (whorled keratinocytes), but no parakeratosis or significant cytological atypia. There is no evidence of a palisading cuticle. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Squamous cell carcinoma in situ",
      "Seborrheic keratosis, irritated variant",
      "Inverted follicular keratosis",
      "Trichilemmoma",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Inverted follicular keratosis presents with endophytic (downward-growing) epidermal proliferation and characteristic squamous eddies (whorls of keratinocytes without parakeratosis). It may be confused with seborrheic keratosis or verruca vulgaris but lacks the cuticle seen in trichilemmomas and does not display marked atypia typical of squamous cell carcinoma in situ. The absence of horn pseudocysts and the unique histologic findings support this diagnosis."

He reports significant discomfort with swallowing and photosensitivity. Examination reveals multiple tense bullae on erythematous bases that do not rupture easily, with negative Nikolsky sign. Biopsy from the edge of a blister demonstrates subepidermal clefting with a mixed inflammatory infiltrate, including neutrophils and eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin reveals linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone. Which of the following autoantigens is most likely implicated in the pathogenesis of this disorder?",
    "choices": [
      "Desmoglein 3",
      "Type VII collagen",
      "BP180 (Collagen XVII)",
      "Laminin 332 (epiligrin)",
      "Desmoglein 1"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This is a case of mucous membrane (cicatricial) pemphigoid, characterized by chronic, scarring blistering of the mucous membranes and, less often, the skin. The classic immunopathologic finding is linear IgG and C3 deposition at the basement membrane zone. Several autoantigens may be targeted, but severe mucosal involvement, especially with ocular and oropharyngeal disease, is most commonly associated with antibodies against Laminin 332 (epiligrin). Option 1 & 5 (Desmoglein 3/1) are pemphigus antigens. Option 2 (Type VII collagen) is associated with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita. Option 3 (BP180/Collagen XVII) is seen in bullous pemphigoid. Thus, the correct answer is Laminin 332 (epiligrin)."

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario outlines features of Cowden syndrome (multiple trichilemmomas in midfacial distribution, acral keratoses, oral papillomas, skin tags, macrocephaly, mild intellectual disability, and a family history of hamartomas and thyroid lesions). Cerebellar dysplastic gangliocytoma (Lhermitte-Duclos disease) and multiple GI hamartomatous polyps are classic associations with Cowden syndrome, making option 4 the best answer. The other options describe findings in other syndromes: option 1 (Carney complex or tuberous sclerosis), option 2 (encephalocraniocutaneous lipomatosis), option 3 (Gorlin syndrome), and option 5 (steatocystoma multiplex/pachyonychia congenita)."

He reports that the plaques often recur in the same locations, especially during the winter, and that topical steroids have only partial effectiveness. A punch biopsy of the lesion is performed. Histologically, the upper epidermis shows loss of nuclei in the stratum corneum, but in some areas, nuclei persist within the cornified layer. Based on this finding, what is the most likely histopathological process responsible for the persistent nuclei in the stratum corneum of this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Normal keratinocyte maturation and terminal differentiation",
      "Excessive apoptosis in the basal cell layer",

      "Autoimmune targeting of TG-3 in the basal epidermis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Parakeratosis refers to the retention of nuclei in the stratum corneum and is a key histopathologic feature of psoriasis, which matches the scenario described. Normally, the stratum corneum should not contain nuclei (option 0), but in conditions like psoriasis, incomplete keratinocyte maturation leads to this abnormal retention of nuclei. Excessive apoptosis (option 1) and calcium gradients (option 3) are involved in normal differentiation, but do not explain parakeratosis. Autoimmune targeting of transglutaminase 3 (TG-3) (option 4) is seen in dermatitis herpetiformis, not psoriasis."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "When maternal varicella infection occurs 5 days before to 2 days after delivery, insufficient maternal antibodies are transferred to the neonate, leading to severe neonatal varicella with onset at 5\u201310 days of age. The optimal management is administration of varicella zoster immunoglobulin (VZIG) and intravenous acyclovir to reduce morbidity and mortality. The other choices are incorrect in this setting."

The diagnosis relies on identifying increased numbers of mast cells around dilated dermal vessels. Tryptase (or c-kit) is a highly sensitive and specific immunohistochemical stain for mast cells, which distinguishes TMEP from other causes of vascular macules. Fontana-Masson is used for melanin, EVG for elastic fibers (e.g., elastolysis), PAS for carbohydrates (e.g., fungal infections), and S100 for neural or melanocytic cells."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a lifelong history of recurrent blistering and erosions on his hands and feet since infancy, often triggered by minor trauma. Examination reveals several atrophic scars and milia at sites of previous blisters. His nails are dystrophic. A skin biopsy at the edge of a fresh blister demonstrates a split within the lamina lucida of the basement membrane zone. Immunofluorescence mapping shows loss of staining for laminin 332 at the dermoepidermal junction. Which of the following best explains the patient's clinical findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Defective assembly of hemidesmosomal integrins leading to reduced anchorage of basal keratinocytes",
      "Mutation in collage VII gene impairing anchoring fibril formation",
      "Absent keratin 14 protein in basal keratinocytes compromising cytoskeletal stability",
      "Loss of function of laminin 332 resulting in defective anchoring filaments at the dermoepidermal junction",
      "Overproduction of fibronectin, disrupting basement membrane organization"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a form of junctional epidermolysis bullosa (JEB), which involves blistering at the level of the lamina lucida. Loss of staining for laminin 332 (also known as laminin 5 or epiligrin), a crucial component of anchoring filaments, indicates that defective anchoring between the basal keratinocytes and the underlying basement membrane is the pathological mechanism. While integrin and collagen VII mutations also cause forms of epidermolysis bullosa, the lamina lucida splitting and loss of laminin 332 are specific for JEB due to laminin 332 mutations. Keratin 14 is involved in a different EB variant (EBS), and fibronectin overproduction is not a known cause of inherited blistering diseases."

    "question": "A 23-year-old man presents with a slowly enlarging patch of hair loss on the scalp, with no signs of inflammation, erythema, or scarring. The surrounding skin appears normal. Trichoscopy reveals short vellus hairs at the periphery of the patch. A skin biopsy shows loss of hair follicles in the affected area, with preserved sebaceous glands and no interface change or significant lymphocytic infiltrate. Further investigation reveals that hair follicle stem cells remain present in the bulge region, but there is a reduction in primed stem cells in the hair germ. Which of the following signaling or molecular pathways is most likely disrupted in this patient, leading to his clinical findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Notch signaling in basal-to-spinous cell transition",
      "Integrin-mediated adhesion to laminin-5 in the basement membrane",
      "FGF-7 and FGF-10 mediated proliferation of basal cells",
      "Maintenance or activation of hair germ stem cells",
      "Melanocyte migration and differentiation pathways"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes a non-scarring alopecia (possibly alopecia areata or similar reversible cause) where hair follicle stem cells remain in the bulge but the hair germ population is depleted. The hair germ contains the primed HFSCs required to regenerate the lower follicle and regrow new hair. A disruption in the signaling pathways responsible for maintenance or activation of these hair germ stem cells prevents normal hair follicle cycling and regeneration, resulting in hair loss. The other options pertain to either other layers of the epidermis (Notch signaling, integrins, and FGF signals), or to pigmentation, not hair cycling."

    "question": "A 25-year-old man presents with well-demarcated, erythematous, scaly plaques on his elbows and knees consistent with chronic plaque psoriasis. He has tried multiple over-the-counter emollients with minimal improvement. His past medical history is unremarkable. On examination, the plaques are thick with notable scaling, and there is no evidence of infection or atrophy. He is particularly concerned about greasy residue due to his occupation as a typist. Which is the most appropriate initial topical therapy vehicle for this patient to optimize both efficacy and adherence?",
    "choices": [
      "Ointment-based potent topical corticosteroid",
      "Cream-based moderate-potency topical corticosteroid",
      "Gel-based high-potency topical corticosteroid",
      "Alcohol-based solution containing topical corticosteroid",
      "Foam-based low-potency topical corticosteroid"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "For chronic plaque psoriasis with thick scaling on non-sensitive areas like elbows and knees, potent or high-potency topical corticosteroids are appropriate. An ointment vehicle would maximize absorption but can be greasy, reducing compliance in patients concerned about residue. Creams are less greasy but may be less effective for thick plaques. Gels are non-greasy, dry quickly, and are well tolerated for patients who handle paperwork or type, maximizing adherence while delivering potent medication to thick plaques. Alcohol- or solution-based vehicles are best for hair-bearing areas, while foams are generally reserved for scalp or large areas needing rapid application."

    "question": "A 70-year-old fair-skinned man presents with a 3-month history of a slowly enlarging lesion on his left forearm. On examination, there is a 1.5 cm pink plaque with a raised, pearly border and a central ulcer. Close-up reveals some focal crusting at the base of the ulcer, but no significant scale. The surrounding sun-exposed skin shows actinic damage. A punch biopsy is performed, and histopathology shows large aggregates of basaloid keratinocytes with peripheral palisading and retraction of the surrounding stroma, creating clefts. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Nodular melanoma",
      "Basal cell carcinoma, nodular type",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma in situ",
      "Actinic keratosis",
      "Seborrheic keratosis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical description\u2014a slowly enlarging pink plaque with a pearly border and central ulceration on sun-exposed skin\u2014strongly suggests basal cell carcinoma (BCC). Histopathology further confirms the diagnosis, as large aggregates of basaloid keratinocytes ('tumor islands'), peripheral palisading, and stromal retraction (clefting) are classic features of BCC, especially the nodular type, which is the most common and less aggressive pattern. The other options do not fit both the clinical and histological picture as well as nodular BCC."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of sun exposure presents with a rapidly growing, dome-shaped nodule on the dorsal hand. The lesion has a central keratin-filled crater. On biopsy, there is pronounced keratinization, crater formation, and neutrophilic microabscesses. The margins show sharp demarcation between tumor and stroma with notable 'epithelial lipping.' There is minimal pleomorphism and mitotic activity. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Well-differentiated squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Verrucous carcinoma",
      "Keratoacanthoma",
      "Cutaneous metastatic adenocarcinoma",
      "Giant molluscum contagiosum"

    "explanation": "Keratoacanthoma (KA) is characterized by a central keratin-filled crater, rapid growth, pronounced keratinization, and histopathological features including neutrophilic microabscesses and sharp demarcation ('epithelial lipping') with the stroma. Unlike well-differentiated SCC, KA shows less pleomorphism and mitotic activity. SCC is more likely to demonstrate ulceration, marked cellular pleomorphism, and lacks the sharp tumor-stroma demarcation seen in KA."

He reports tightness in his hands and decreased range of motion over several weeks. On exam, he has poikiloderma over the shoulders and lichen planus-like violaceous papules on the legs. Laboratory studies reveal mild thrombocytopenia and elevated bilirubin. What is the next best step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Begin high-potency topical corticosteroids and monitor for response.",
      "Initiate high-dose systemic corticosteroids and consider addition of a calcineurin inhibitor.",
      "Start PUVA phototherapy for cutaneous sclerosis.",
      "Refer for emergent plasmapheresis due to risk of organ failure.",
      "Begin narrowband UVB phototherapy as first-line for skin involvement."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes moderate to severe chronic graft-versus-host disease (cGVHD) involving skin (lichenoid papules, sclerosis, poikiloderma), oral mucosa (erosions), and liver (elevated bilirubin), with functional impairment (limited joint mobility) and hematologic involvement (thrombocytopenia). According to the referenced guidelines, moderate to severe cGVHD requires prompt initiation of systemic immunosuppression \u2014 typically high-dose corticosteroids \u2014 and may require a steroid-sparing agent such as a calcineurin inhibitor. Topical corticosteroids alone are insufficient. PUVA and UVB therapies are not first-line for extensive, multisystem disease, and plasmapheresis is not indicated in this setting."

His parents report that he developed pale, leaf-shaped patches on his trunk shortly after birth, and, over the past two years, small, firm papules have appeared symmetrically on his cheeks and nose. Physical examination reveals numerous hypopigmented 'ash leaf' macules on his trunk and a thickened, leathery plaque on his lower back. Multiple reddish papules are clustered across the nasolabial folds. His fingernails show periungual fibromas. Developmental assessment reveals mild intellectual impairment. Which additional finding is most likely to be present in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Multiple capillary hemangiomas of the retina",
      "Congenital cardiac rhabdomyomas",
      "Confluent cafe-au-lait macules with axillary freckling",
      "Jaundice with grayish-tan macular hyperpigmentation on the limbs",
      "Segmental vitiligo and nail dystrophy"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This child has classic features of tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC): hypopigmented 'ash leaf' macules, angiofibromas (formerly adenoma sebaceum) on the face, a shagreen patch (leathery back plaque), periungual fibromas, and neurodevelopmental impairment. Additional findings associated with TSC include congenital cardiac rhabdomyomas, which may present with arrhythmias or regress in childhood. Retinal capillary hemangiomas are seen in von Hippel-Lindau disease, while cafe-au-lait macules with axillary freckling are characteristic of neurofibromatosis type 1. Jaundice with hyperpigmented macules and segmental vitiligo are not features of TSC; nail dystrophy with hyperpigmentation is more consistent with incontinentia pigmenti."

The skin is dusky, tense, and shows areas of blistering and patchy necrosis. He is febrile and tachycardic. On examination, there is crepitus, and the affected area is exquisitely tender beyond the margin of visible erythema. He has a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus. Laboratory results show marked leukocytosis and elevated creatine kinase. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cellulitis",

      "Actinomycosis",
      "Borreliosis (Lyme disease)"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Necrotizing fasciitis is a rapidly progressive, life-threatening infection of the fascia and subcutaneous tissues. It is characterized by severe pain (out of proportion to findings), rapid tissue destruction, systemic toxicity, and often crepitus. Dusky discoloration, blistering, necrosis, and systemic upset are classic. Cellulitis and erysipelas are less aggressive and usually lack such rapid progression, severe pain, and tissue necrosis. Actinomycosis and borreliosis are chronic, indolent processes and do not typically present with acute necrosis or crepitus."

He has tried topical steroids, with only temporary improvement, and the affected area has continued to enlarge. No involvement of the face, groin, or hands is found. The lesion now covers much of his torso and consists of concentric, polycyclic rings with scaling at the edges but relatively clear centers. He denies pruritus, mucous membrane involvement, or systemic symptoms. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Tinea corporis",
      "Tinea imbricata",
      "Tinea incognito",
      "Nummular eczema",
      "Psoriasis vulgaris"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Tinea imbricata is a distinctive dermatophyte infection, most commonly caused by Trichophyton concentricum, characterized by chronic, expanding concentric rings (imbricate pattern) primarily on the trunk and limbs. The history of steroid use with little effect and the characteristic clinical appearance supports this diagnosis. Tinea corporis presents as annular lesions but not typically with concentric rings. Tinea incognito refers to modified tinea due to steroid use but is less likely to display an imbricate pattern. Nummular eczema and psoriasis vulgaris would present differently and lack the concentric scaling."

On examination, he is ill-appearing with purpuric papules and plaques scattered on his legs, a few of which show central necrosis. Laboratory findings reveal leukocytosis and positive blood cultures for Neisseria meningitidis. A skin biopsy demonstrates leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving both small and medium-sized vessels, with vascular thrombi containing neutrophils in and around vessel walls, and necrosis of the epidermis and superficial dermis. Which feature most strongly distinguishes this vasculitis from rheumatoid vasculitis and microscopic polyangiitis?",
    "choices": [
      "The presence of leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving both small and medium vessels",
      "The association with positive blood cultures and acute systemic infection",
      "Necrosis of the epidermis and superficial dermis on histology",
      "Vascular thrombi within the dermal vessels",
      "The demonstration of neutrophils in and around vessel walls"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The association with positive blood cultures and acute systemic infection most strongly points toward septic vasculitis, especially meningococcemia, and clearly distinguishes it from rheumatoid vasculitis and microscopic polyangiitis. Both septic vasculitis and the other entities may show leukocytoclastic vasculitis of small and medium vessels, epidermal/dermal necrosis, vascular thrombi, and neutrophilic infiltrates histologically, but only septic vasculitis is tied to acute infection and positive blood cultures."

He reports a history of chronic sun exposure and a remote history of tobacco use. On inspection, the lesion appears ulcerated and extends onto the vermilion border. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. A punch biopsy is performed. Which of the following findings on histopathology would most strongly support the diagnosis of squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Sheets of atypical melanocytes at the dermal-epidermal junction",
      "B. Proliferation of atypical keratinocytes with invasion into the dermis, formation of keratin pearls, and intercellular bridges",

      "E. Well-circumscribed lobules of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading",
      "correct: 1,",
      "explanation: Option B is correct. Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) of the skin typically shows a proliferation of atypical keratinocytes invading into the dermis, often with keratin pearl formation (concentric layers of keratin) and intercellular bridges. This histopathology, in combination with the clinical picture\u2014a firm, hyperkeratotic nodule on a sun-exposed area in an elderly man\u2014strongly supports SCC. The other options describe histologic findings of melanoma (A), lichen planus (C), granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis (D), and basal cell carcinoma (E). SCCs are most common on sun-exposed areas, including the lower lip, and are associated with risk factors such as age, chronic sun exposure, and tobacco use."

She reports having noticed the first lesion soon after recovering from a minor burn at that site. Physical exam reveals multiple flaccid, wrinkled, sac-like areas of skin; the overlying epidermis appears normal. A punch biopsy is performed, and H&E staining shows no significant abnormalities. However, special elastic tissue stains (Verhoeff\u2013van Gieson) reveal marked loss of elastic fibers in the superficial and mid-dermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Papillary dermal elastolysis",
      "Mid-dermal elastolysis",
      "Anetoderma",
      "Atrophoderma of Pasini and Pierini",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Anetoderma presents with atrophic, wrinkled, sac-like patches that may occur at sites of prior trauma or inflammation. The key histopathological finding is a loss of elastic fibers in the superficial and mid-dermis, evident only on special stains such as Verhoeff\u2013van Gieson. The H&E stain may appear normal. Dermal elastolysis (choices A and B) features loss of elastic fibers, but is confined to either the papillary or the mid-dermis, not both.

During her counseling, she expresses concern about potential mood changes because her cousin became depressed while on isotretinoin. She also mentions she takes an oral combination contraceptive pill and worries about possible drug interactions if she also needs to take antibiotics for her acne flares. Which statement best reflects evidence-based guidance you can provide her?",
    "choices": [
      "Isotretinoin is contraindicated in any patient with a personal or family history of depression.",
      "Concurrent use of non-enzyme-inducing antibiotics with oral contraceptives significantly reduces contraceptive efficacy, so backup contraception is indicated.",
      "Isotretinoin use may be associated with depression, but most studies, including large cohort analyses, have not established a strong causal relationship.",
      "Contraceptive failures are common in patients taking isotretinoin due to drug-drug interaction with oral contraceptives.",
      "Rifampin is the antibiotic of choice for acne flares in women on isotretinoin and oral contraceptives."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Most studies, including large cohort analyses, have not established a strong causal relationship between isotretinoin and depression; while mood changes have been reported, absolute risk is unproven. Regarding oral contraceptives, non-enzyme-inducing antibiotics (such as tetracyclines) do not significantly reduce contraceptive efficacy and routine use of backup contraception is not necessary. Rifampin is an enzyme inducer that can reduce contraceptive efficacy, but it is not a standard acne therapy. Isotretinoin is not absolutely contraindicated in those with mood disorder history but should be used with caution."

On examination, he is febrile with cervical and axillary lymphadenopathy, and facial edema. Blood work reveals leukocytosis with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytosis, mild transaminitis, and creatinine elevation with proteinuria. Chest X-ray reveals patchy bilateral infiltrates. Which of the following organ manifestations, if present, would be most specific for severe disease and poorest prognosis in this syndrome?",
    "choices": [

Typical findings include fever, lymphadenopathy, hematologic abnormalities (eosinophilia, atypical lymphocytosis), and involvement of multiple organs (hepatic, renal, pulmonary, cardiac). Among the listed options, acute necrotizing eosinophilic myocarditis is the most severe, confers the poorest prognosis, and is highly specific for life-threatening organ involvement. While hepatic, renal, and pulmonary involvement are common, cardiac involvement, especially with acute necrotizing myocarditis, is rare and often fatal, making it the most concerning prognostic factor."

Under light microscopy, it shows fraying and splitting (nodes) along the hair shaft. It presents with easily broken hairs of various lengths, and the underlying hair shaft is structurally abnormal but other ectodermal structures are normal. Trichotillomania may show broken hairs but is usually associated with psychiatric history. Alopecia areata usually presents with smooth patches of alopecia and exclamation mark hairs without a history of fragility. Monilethrix and pili torti are hair shaft abnormalities but have distinctive beading (monilethrix) or twisting (pili torti), and often develop earlier in childhood."

The child is otherwise healthy. The papules are asymptomatic and there is no history of trauma or similar rashes in the family. On examination, the papules are monomorphic, 2\u20134 mm in diameter, and there is no scaling or surface change. There is no lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. A skin biopsy is performed, which reveals a dermal infiltrate of histiocytes with abundant cytoplasm without atypia, no evidence of Birbeck granules, and is negative for S100 and CD1a. Immunostaining is positive for CD68. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

Benign cephalic histiocytosis (BCH) typically presents as monomorphic papules on the head and neck in infants or young children and is self-limited. Juvenile xanthogranuloma may present similarly but often shows Touton giant cells histologically. Langerhans cell histiocytosis would display Birbeck granules and be CD1a/S100 positive.

Physical exam reveals multiple large, intact bullae on erythematous skin. Skin biopsy demonstrates a subepidermal blister with abundant eosinophils and minimal neutrophilic infiltrate. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) shows linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone. A salt-split skin test is performed, and immunoreactivity is found on the roof of the artificially split blister. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is pancreatic panniculitis secondary to pancreatic carcinoma. The case fits the classic clinical scenario: tender, erythematous nodules with oily discharge (suggesting fat necrosis), associated joint symptoms (polyarthritis), and a background of elevated pancreatic enzymes and systemic symptoms such as weight loss. Histology reveals 'ghost cells,' characteristic of enzymatic fat necrosis. Pancreatic panniculitis most commonly arises from pancreatic cancer (especially acinar cell carcinoma) or severe pancreatitis, often presenting before pancreatic disease is detected.

His developmental milestones are appropriate for age. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly",
      "Cutis Laxa",
      "Pseudoxanthoma Elasticum",
      "Focal Dermal Hypoplasia (Goltz Syndrome)",
      "Beare-Stevenson Cutis Gyrata Syndrome"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a connective tissue disorder that presents in childhood with arachnodactyly (long, slender fingers), multiple joint contractures, crumpled ears, scoliosis, and occasionally mild cardiovascular involvement (aortic root dilation)\u2014but without significant skin laxity or cutis laxa. This is most consistent with Congenital Contractural Arachnodactyly, which is related to (but distinct from) Marfan syndrome, and is characterized by the presence of congenital joint contractures and characteristic 'crumpled' ears. The other conditions listed would present with distinguishing features not seen here: Cutis laxa (loose, sagging skin), Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (yellowish papules, eye, and vascular involvement), Focal dermal hypoplasia (Blaschkoid skin atrophy, limb/mucosal defects), and Beare-Stevenson syndrome (cutaneous gyrations and craniosynostosis)."

    "question": "A 2-week-old infant is brought to the dermatology clinic with multiple blistering lesions on the trunk and extremities that appeared within hours after birth. The blisters are tense, some erosions are present, and there is evidence of scarring and milia formation. The infant\u2019s parents are non-consanguineous; there is no family history of skin disorders. Examination reveals mitten deformities of the hands. Skin biopsy demonstrates sublamina densa cleavage on electron microscopy, and immunofluorescence mapping shows absence of type VII collagen at the basement membrane zone.

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes an infant with congenital blistering, scarring, and mitten deformities\u2014hallmarks of a severe type of epidermolysis bullosa. The key diagnostic clue is the absence of type VII collagen and sublamina densa cleavage, which are characteristic of dystrophic EB. The autosomal recessive generalized severe (formerly 'Hallopeau-Siemens') type is notable for early onset, severe blistering, scarring, and mitten deformities. Other options can be excluded based on the clinical, histologic, and ultrastructural findings."

She has no significant medical history but was recently started on cyclosporine for lupus nephritis. On examination, she has increased dark terminal hairs on her face, but her menses are regular and there are no signs of virilization. What is the most likely underlying mechanism of her hair change?",
    "choices": [
      "Drug-induced conversion of vellus to terminal hairs (acquired terminal hypertrichosis)",
      "Androgen excess from ovarian dysfunction",
      "Autoimmune-mediated follicular damage",
      "Thyroid hormone deficiency leading to lanugo hair formation",
      "Paraneoplastic syndrome causing lanugo hair"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The patient's history, exam, and recent cyclosporine use point to drug-induced acquired terminal hypertrichosis. Cyclosporine is a well-known medication that can trigger the conversion of vellus hairs to terminal hairs, particularly on the face, leading to increased coarse hair growth (hypertrichosis). Other options are less likely based on the context: androgen excess would usually lead to additional signs of virilization; autoimmune-mediated follicular damage causes hair loss; thyroid hormone deficiency or paraneoplastic syndromes typically cause lanugo hair, not terminal hypertrichosis."

    "question": "A 36-year-old man presents with a slowly enlarging solitary violaceous papule on his lower extremity. The lesion has a red, slightly raised center with a darker peripheral ring. There is no history of trauma. Dermoscopy reveals a targetoid appearance. Histological examination demonstrates dilated vascular channels in the upper dermis lined by hobnail endothelial cells, with more slit-like vessels and prominent red blood cell extravasation and hemosiderin deposition at the lesion's edge. HHV-8 immunostaining is negative. What is the most appropriate diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Kaposi sarcoma",
      "Glomeruloid hemangioma",
      "Targetoid hemosiderotic (hobnail) hemangioma",
      "Microvenular hemangioma",
      "Reactive angioendotheliomatosis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histopathologic findings are characteristic of targetoid hemosiderotic (hobnail) hemangioma. The targetoid appearance is due to central dilated blood vessels (red center) and peripheral extravasation of erythrocytes and hemosiderin (brown rim). Histology shows dilated vascular channels with hobnail endothelial cells, and peripheral slit-like vessels. HHV-8 negativity helps distinguish this entity from Kaposi sarcoma. Other options either do not match the histopathology (glomeruloid capillary loops filled with immunoglobulin\u2014glomeruloid hemangioma) or clinical presentation."

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents for shave excision of a dysplastic nevus but reports a previous severe allergic reaction to local anesthesia during a dental procedure. The dentist\u2019s records indicate the anesthetic used was lidocaine. The patient has a history of urticaria and facial swelling after lidocaine administration, confirmed not to be due to vasovagal or syncopal episodes. She has not had reactions to other medications. The dermatologist plans a small shave biopsy. Which is the most appropriate anesthetic approach for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Proceed with injection of lidocaine, as true allergy is extremely rare and reactions are usually vasovagal.",
      "Use benzocaine (an ester-type anesthetic) for infiltration anesthesia, as it is not cross-reactive with lidocaine.",
      "Use injectable diphenhydramine for anesthesia, understanding its slower onset and efficacy profile.",
      "Apply EMLA cream (eutectic mixture of lidocaine and prilocaine) under occlusion for topical anesthesia prior to the procedure.",
      "Buffer lidocaine with sodium bicarbonate to reduce pain and risk of allergy."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "True allergic reactions to lidocaine (an amide anesthetic) are extremely rare but, when confirmed, require avoidance of amide-type anesthetics. Ester-type anesthetics like benzocaine are preferred alternatives, as cross-reactivity is uncommon. However, benzocaine is typically used topically, not for infiltration. For small procedures, injectable diphenhydramine can be used as a less effective, but safer, alternative for patients with true lidocaine allergy. EMLA contains amide anesthetics and could also pose a risk. Buffered lidocaine addresses pain, not allergy risk."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia presents with fever and the rapid onset of painful purple nodules on his thighs and upper arms, some of which evolve into bullae and ulcerate. Two weeks prior, he started allopurinol and cotrimoxazole. On examination, he is systemically unwell, with targetoid lesions and mucosal erosions. Laboratory tests reveal elevated liver enzymes and eosinophilia. Skin biopsy shows marked interface dermatitis and necrotic keratinocytes throughout the epidermis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Acute cutaneous lupus erythematosus",
      "Stevens-Johnson syndrome (SJS)/Toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN)",
      "Sweet syndrome",
      "DRESS syndrome (Drug Reaction with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms)"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "This scenario demonstrates a severe drug reaction occurring after initiation of new medications (allopurinol and cotrimoxazole), with systemic symptoms (fever, malaise, hepatitis), cutaneous findings (painful erythematous nodules, bullae, ulceration), mucosal involvement, and laboratory abnormalities (eosinophilia, elevated liver enzymes). DRESS syndrome is characterized by these features, including skin eruption, systemic involvement (especially the liver), and hematologic abnormalities. The biopsy showing interface dermatitis can be seen in DRESS. SJS/TEN would involve more extensive epidermal necrosis and sloughing, but the prominent eosinophilia, hepatic involvement, and timeline support DRESS syndrome."

    "question": "A 35-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic in July after a recent beach vacation. He has developed multiple erythematous, pruritic papules scattered over his shoulders and upper back. He reports diligently applying sunscreen at the start of each day but admits to reapplying it only once during long periods outside and after swimming. He used a sunscreen containing only oxybenzone. He denies any systemic symptoms. On examination, there is no blistering or systemic involvement. What is the most likely explanation for his skin findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Sunscreen-induced contact dermatitis due to oxybenzone sensitivity",
      "Polymorphous light eruption due to insufficient UVB protection",
      "Chemical burn from sunscreen vehicle ingredients",
      "Irritant folliculitis from sunscreen physical blockers",
      "Phototoxic reaction due to avobenzone in the sunscreen"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient used a sunscreen containing only oxybenzone, a UVA blocker, and did not frequently reapply it during sun exposure or after swimming. This resulted in inadequate UVB protection, predisposing him to polymorphous light eruption (PMLE)\u2014a photo-induced, pruritic eruption that can occur with insufficient UVB shielding. The scenario highlights the importance of broad-spectrum protection and regular reapplication, especially after swimming or sweating. The other choices are less likely based on the clinical presentation and ingredients used."

There has been some loss of eyelashes in the affected area. No similar lesions are present elsewhere on the skin. His past medical history is significant for colon cancer diagnosed in his 50s. Ophthalmology performs an excisional biopsy. On histology, there are lobules and strands of atypical cells infiltrating the dermis, with prominent cytoplasmic vacuolization, atypical mitoses, and pagetoid spread in the overlying epidermis. Immunohistochemistry is positive for epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and adipophilin. What is the most likely diagnosis in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Basal cell carcinoma",
      "Sebaceous carcinoma",
      "Merkel cell carcinoma",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Chalazion"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a nodule on the upper eyelid, the most common location for sebaceous carcinoma. The lesion\u2019s color, associated eyelash loss, and the patient\u2019s prior colon cancer suggest a possible Muir-Torre syndrome association. Histopathological features\u2014lobules of atypical cells, cytoplasmic vacuolization, atypical mitoses, pagetoid spread, and positive EMA and adipophilin staining\u2014are classic for sebaceous carcinoma. Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma typically do not present with these histological or immunohistochemical findings; Merkel cell carcinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor usually positive for cytokeratin 20; chalazion is a benign inflammatory lesion, not malignant."

He now develops new skin lesions: multiple small, ulcerated papules on his trunk. A dermatologist is consulted. Which of the following is the most appropriate intravenous antiviral agent that is usually active against CMV isolates resistant to both ganciclovir and foscarnet?",

She also reports low-grade fever and arthralgia, and she recently started taking oral contraceptive pills. She denies respiratory symptoms, recent travel, or any gastrointestinal complaints. Physical examination shows multiple 2-3 cm tender, non-ulcerated, deep red nodules over the anterior tibial surfaces. Laboratory workup is notable for a mild leukocytosis, but otherwise unremarkable. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Sweet\u2019s syndrome",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum",
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Beh\u00e7et\u2019s disease",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient presents with the clinical features of erythema nodosum: tender, erythematous subcutaneous nodules on the shins, associated with systemic symptoms such as fever and arthralgia. The history of starting oral contraceptives is significant as this is a known trigger. Sweet's syndrome typically presents with plaques and neutrophilic dermatosis, pyoderma gangrenosum features rapidly progressing ulcers with violaceous borders, Beh\u00e7et\u2019s involves oral/genital ulcers, and erythema induratum is more strongly linked with nodules and ulceration on the posterior legs, typically seen in TB. No findings suggest an infectious, bowel disease, or other cause, making drug-induced erythema nodosum most likely."

    "question": "A 7-month-old boy is brought to the clinic with a 2-week history of irritability, chronic diarrhea, and a new rash. He was born at term without complications and initially breastfed exclusively but was recently transitioned to formula and solids. The skin findings began on his cheeks and around his mouth and quickly extended to the perianal area and distal extremities. On exam, he has sharply demarcated erythematous plaques with erosions, vesicles, and crusting around the perioral, perianal, and acral regions. Laboratory tests show mildly low albumin and markedly decreased alkaline phosphatase activity. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this patient's presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Primary lactase deficiency causing malabsorptive diarrhea and irritation",
      "Inherited abnormality of intestinal zinc transporter leading to micronutrient deficiency",
      "Essential fatty acid deficiency due to premature birth and inadequate nutrition",
      "Autoimmune destruction of Langerhans cells resulting in skin and systemic symptoms",
      "Chronic exposure to stool causing irritant contact dermatitis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This child's presentation fits classic acrodermatitis enteropathica: periorificial and acral vesiculobullous and erosive dermatitis, diarrhea, and irritability, developing after weaning from breastmilk, with low alkaline phosphatase (a zinc-dependent enzyme). The key is the inherited defect in an intestinal zinc transporter (SLC39A4), which manifests dramatically after transition off maternal milk, whose zinc is better absorbed. Other options are incorrect: lactase deficiency causes abdominal symptoms but not this rash; essential fatty acid deficiency doesn't present with sharply demarcated erosions in these sites; Langerhans cell histiocytoses have different lesions and multisystem findings; chronic irritant dermatitis lacks systemic features and classic distribution."

His fingers and toes appear swollen and distorted under the thick skin. Eye eversion (ectropion) and eclabium are noted. The pregnancy was uneventful, and there is no family history of similar skin disorders. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "The described presentation of a neonate with thick, hard, plate-like scales covering the entire body, deep fissures, and characteristic facial abnormalities including ectropion and eclabium is classic for Harlequin ichthyosis. This is a severe autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis marked by severe barrier dysfunction, which can be life-threatening in the neonatal period. The other types (lamellar ichthyosis, ichthyosis vulgaris, nonbullous congenital ichthyosiform erythroderma, X-linked ichthyosis) have milder presentations and lack the dramatic features of Harlequin ichthyosis."

His mother was diagnosed with melanoma at age 45, and his maternal uncle died from metastatic melanoma at age 52. Examination reveals an irregular 1.3 cm asymmetric pigmented macule with variegated pigmentation and notched borders. He undergoes a punch biopsy, confirming malignant melanoma. Given his family history, what is the most appropriate next step in his genetic risk assessment and counseling?",
    "choices": [
      "Reassurance, as familial melanoma makes up less than 5% of cases",
      "Genetic testing for BRAF and NRAS mutations, as these are the most common genes in familial melanoma",
      "Offer genetic counseling and testing for CDKN2A and CDK4 mutations",
      "Genetic testing is not indicated unless the patient is younger than 30 years old",
      "Test for PTEN mutations, as these are most commonly seen in familial melanoma"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes a patient with a strong family history of melanoma and personal risk factors (multiple blistering sunburns). In familial melanoma syndromes, CDKN2A and CDK4 are the two main genes in which mutations confer high risk. Genetic counseling and testing for mutations in CDKN2A and CDK4 are indicated in patients with such suspicious family histories. BRAF and NRAS mutations are more commonly somatic mutations seen in sporadic melanoma and are not typically tested in the context of familial risk assessment. PTEN mutations are more related to Cowden syndrome and are not the predominant risk in familial melanoma."

Some nodules have fistulized and drained serous fluid. She has no systemic symptoms. Examination reveals several violaceous nodules arranged in a sporotrichoid pattern proximal to the tattoo. A punch biopsy demonstrates granulomatous inflammation; Fite stain is negative for acid-fast bacilli, but mycobacterial culture after one week shows rapid growth of non-tuberculous mycobacteria. What is the most likely causative organism?",
    "choices": [
      "Mycobacterium marinum",
      "Mycobacterium tuberculosis",
      "Mycobacterium fortuitum complex",
      "Sporothrix schenckii",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes nodular lesions appearing after tattooing, with sporotrichoid spread and rapid growth of non-tuberculous mycobacteria in culture. Mycobacterium fortuitum complex (including M. fortuitum, M. chelonae, and M. abscessus) are rapid growers typically found in soil and water, and are known causes of cutaneous infection after exposure to contaminated tattoo ink or instruments. Mycobacterium marinum also presents with sporotrichoid lesions but grows more slowly and is linked to aquatic exposure. Sporothrix schenckii is a fungus, not a bacteria. Staphylococcus aureus would present differently, and M. tuberculosis is not a rapid grower and rarely causes this pattern in the immunocompetent."

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman undergoes a cosmetic midface lift. During the procedure, dissection is performed in the superficial fat layer above the SMAS. Afterwards, the patient is noted to have an inability to raise her right eyebrow and flattening of the right forehead, but she is able to close her eyes completely and move other areas of her face. What is the most likely explanation for her specific deficit?",
    "choices": [
      "Injury to the buccal branch of the facial nerve in the deep fat plane",
      "Transection of the frontal branch of the trigeminal nerve in the upper forehead",
      "Damage to the temporal branch of the facial nerve at its course beneath the SMAS within the lateral brow danger zone",
      "Direct trauma to the zygomatic branch of the facial nerve at the malar eminence",
      "Thermal injury to the marginal mandibular branch at the inferior mandibular border"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient's inability to raise her eyebrow and forehead flattening specifically indicate dysfunction of the frontalis muscle, which is innervated by the temporal branch of the facial nerve. This nerve lies beneath the SMAS within a rectangular danger zone extending from the lateral eyebrow to the anterior hairline. Dissection in this area above the SMAS, if carried too deep or uncontrolled, can injure the temporal branch, resulting in the clinical deficit described. The other branches listed do not cause isolated loss of eyebrow elevation or forehead movement."

On examination, there are multiple flaccid bullae, superficial erosions, and crusted plaques on the malar area, upper chest, and forearms. Nikolsky sign is positive. A biopsy shows suprabasal acantholysis and direct immunofluorescence reveals intercellular IgG deposition in the epidermis. His past medical history is significant for a recent diagnosis of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Which aspect of adaptive immunity most directly contributes to the pathogenesis of his current condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Activation of natural killer (NK) cells by upregulated CD56 expression",
      "Gene rearrangement leading to generation of autoreactive T-cell receptors",
      "Antibody production by B cells targeting desmosomal proteins",

      "Cytokine production by CD4+ T cells orchestrating granulomatous inflammation"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with pemphigus vulgaris, an autoimmune blistering disorder in which B cells (of the adaptive immune system) produce autoantibodies (IgG) against desmogleins, critical components of desmosomes in the epidermis. This disrupts keratinocyte adhesion, leading to flaccid bullae and erosions. The process exemplifies the high specificity and potential autoreactivity conferred by gene rearrangement in the adaptive immune system. While other immune elements may be involved, antibody production by B cells is the principal pathogenic mechanism."

Since then, she has developed erythematous, scaly, and vesicular plaques around her mouth, perianal region, and on the dorsal aspects of her hands and feet. She also has areas of scalp scaling and patchy hair loss. Her parents report increased irritability and two episodes of watery diarrhea in the past week. On examination, the infant is fussy and photophobic, with glossitis and mild cheilitis. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause of her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Acrodermatitis enteropathica due to a defect in the SLC39A4 zinc transporter",
      "Atopic dermatitis triggered by food allergy",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical picture is consistent with acrodermatitis enteropathica, an autosomal recessive disorder caused by mutations in SLC39A4 resulting in defective intestinal zinc absorption. The disease typically presents in infants after weaning from breast milk, with characteristic periorificial and acral dermatitis, alopecia, diarrhea, irritability, and sometimes photophobia and mucosal involvement. The onset after dietary change from breast milk/formula to cow\u2019s milk, along with cutaneous and systemic features, strongly supports this diagnosis.

She also notes violaceous, flat-topped, polygonal papules with white, lacy patterns on her flexor wrists. On examination, her nails show longitudinal ridging and thinning, with some dorsal pterygium formation. Biopsies from oral and wrist lesions both reveal dense, band-like lymphocytic infiltrate at the dermal-epidermal junction, with saw-tooth acanthosis. Fungal stains on biopsy are negative.

She previously underwent two pulsed dye laser (595 nm) treatments with minimal improvement but developed transient post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Now, she inquires about the use of Q-switched lasers. During consultation, you review possible complications. Which of the following is the most likely ocular complication associated with the inappropriate use of Q-switched lasers for pigmented lesions on the face if adequate eye protection is not used?",
    "choices": [
      "Thermal injury to the corneal epithelium due to aqueous absorption of laser energy",
      "Retinal pigment epithelium damage due to absorption by melanin in the retina",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Q-switched lasers used for pigmented lesions emit wavelengths (e.g., 694 nm ruby, 755 nm alexandrite) that are strongly absorbed by pigment, particularly melanin. The retina contains abundant melanin and thus is highly susceptible to injury, especially with poorly shielded use on facial skin. This can result in retinal pigment epithelium damage and even permanent vision loss. Conversely, ablative lasers targeting water can damage the cornea, but this is not the case with pigment-specific Q-switched lasers."

IgE is the immunoglobulin class responsible for immediate allergic reactions. It mediates its effects by binding to high-affinity Fc\u03b5RI receptors on mast cells and basophils; subsequent cross-linking upon antigen exposure triggers mast cell degranulation, releasing histamine and other mediators. The biopsy findings and immune complex deposition are secondary and may reflect a Type III component if significant, but the acute presentation aligns best with IgE-mediated degranulation. IgG and IgM are involved in opsonization and complement activation, but not in immediate hypersensitivity via mast cell degranulation. IgA and IgD do not mediate this response."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with a 4-month history of firm, non-tender papules and nodules clustered on the central face, especially around the eyelids and upper lip. The lesions began as small, reddish papules and have gradually increased in number. He denies any fevers, weight loss, or systemic symptoms. There is no significant past medical history. Examination reveals numerous monomorphic, flesh-toned and yellow-red papules, some with central umbilication, on the cheeks and eyelids. Skin biopsy of a facial nodule demonstrates a well-circumscribed dermal granuloma with central caseation necrosis, surrounded by a lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. No organisms are seen with AFB or GMS stains. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Sarcoidosis",
      "Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei",
      "Granulomatous rosacea",
      "Tuberculosis cutis",
      "Leishmaniasis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Lupus miliaris disseminatus faciei (LMDF) is characterized by papular eruptions on the central face with histopathology showing well-formed, caseating granulomas\u2014an unusual feature for non-infectious granulomas. This distinguishes it from sarcoidosis (which features non-caseating granulomas), granulomatous rosacea (which lacks caseation and often shows perifollicular granulomas and Demodex), cutaneous TB (which would likely show AFB), and leishmaniasis (which would show organisms on GMS or a leishmania stain). LMDF is non-infectious and occurs most commonly on the face, often with central necrosis in granulomas despite negative stains for organisms."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman with type 2 diabetes presents with a 2-month history of enlarging, erythematous, scaly plaques with a central area of erosion involving the perioral, perineal, and lower abdominal regions. She also reports a recent weight loss and new-onset diabetes, but denies any history of alcohol abuse or chronic illness. Skin biopsy demonstrates psoriasiform acanthosis, pallor of the upper epidermis, and prominent ballooning of keratinocytes. There is no evidence of neutrophils in the stratum corneum, and PAS stain is negative. What is the most likely underlying systemic abnormality contributing to her cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Vitamin B3 (niacin) deficiency",
      "Zinc deficiency",
      "Hepatitis C infection",
      "Glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor",
      "Paraneoplastic syndrome associated with an internal malignancy"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes necrolytic migratory erythema, a classic manifestation of glucagonoma syndrome. The histopathologic findings of psoriasiform acanthosis, upper epidermal pallor, and ballooning keratinocytes are characteristic. These findings can also be seen in nutritional deficiency dermatoses, but given the additional context of new-onset diabetes and weight loss, a glucagon-secreting pancreatic tumor is the most likely underlying cause. Pellagra (niacin deficiency) and acrodermatitis enteropathica (zinc deficiency) can mimic these findings histologically, but the clinical presentation and systemic signs point toward glucagonoma."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with complaints of pruritic papules in her axillae that have persisted for several months. She notes they worsen during the summer and with exercise, and describes occasional discomfort but no constitutional symptoms. On examination, there are numerous, small, skin-colored to slightly hyperpigmented, dome-shaped papules clustered in the axillary vault, some with overlying scale. The remainder of her skin and mucosa are unremarkable. She reports that her mother had similar lesions in adolescence. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology of her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Occlusion and rupture of apocrine gland ducts with subsequent perifollicular inflammation",
      "Accumulation of lipofuscin pigment in the apocrine glands leading to colored sweat",
      "Increased production of volatile fatty acids by skin commensals metabolizing apocrine secretions",
      "Disorder of keratinization and nail matrix function",
      "Impairment of eccrine sweat gland function with salt loss"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes Fox-Fordyce disease, which is characterized by pruritic papules in apocrine gland-bearing areas, most often the axillae of young women, and is due to occlusion and rupture of apocrine gland ducts with secondary inflammation. Chromhidrosis (accumulation of lipofuscin pigment) causes colored sweat, while bromhidrosis is due to abnormal body odor from apocrine gland secretions, not papules. Disorders involving the nail matrix and eccrine gland function would present differently."

    "question": "A 15-year-old girl is referred to dermatology due to recurrent skin infections and notable changes of her nails and lower limbs. She has a history of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes. On examination, she is obese, has multiple healed and active boils in her axillae, and has short, broad fingers with hypoplastic nails. She also has folliculitis in the nuchal and occipital regions, and several thick, linear plaques with keratotic plugs in a serpiginous pattern on the lateral aspect of her neck. Additional findings include webbed neck, low posterior hairline, and low-set ears. Her past medical history includes repair of a ventricular septal defect in infancy. Which genetic abnormality most likely explains her constellation of findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Trisomy 21 (Down syndrome)",
      "Trisomy 8",
      "47,XXY (Klinefelter syndrome)",
      "XO (Turner syndrome)",
      "Deletion of the short arm of chromosome 5 (Cri-du-chat syndrome)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient presents with classic dermatological and systemic findings consistent with Turner syndrome (XO). Features like webbed neck, low posterior hairline, low-set ears, hypoplastic nails, short stature, and cardiac defects (VSD) are typical. Her skin findings may include keloids, nuchal folds, and a predisposition to chronic skin infections. The presence of linear plaques with keratotic plugs may be due to elastosis perforans serpiginosa, associated more commonly with genetic syndromes including Turner syndrome. Trisomy 21 could present similarly but is usually associated with Brushfield spots, up-slanting palpebral fissures, and mental retardation rather than the combination of features described. Trisomy 8 is more associated with nail and patellar abnormalities, while Klinefelter syndrome is limited to males. Cri-du-chat presents with a different syndromic spectrum."

Three days postoperatively, he returns with increasing erythema, warmth, swelling, and purulent drainage at the surgical site; the sutures are intact and the wound appears partially dehisced. He is afebrile but complains of mild pain. What is the most appropriate immediate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Start empiric antibiotics and leave sutures in place for continued support.",
      "Remove all sutures, swab wound for culture, irrigate, and allow healing by second intention.",
      "Incise and drain, but leave sutures in and close the wound primarily after.",
      "Begin intravenous antibiotics and close the wound primarily during this visit.",
      "Observe and reassure the patient since he is afebrile."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In the setting of a postoperative wound infection with evidence of local cellulitis and wound dehiscence, all sutures should be removed because they act as a nidus for infection. The wound should be cultured, irrigated, and left to heal by second intention. Antibiotics should also be started. Merely starting antibiotics while leaving sutures in place will not adequately address ongoing infection. Reclosing an infected wound is not appropriate."

    "question": "A 29-year-old man with a 15-year history of moderate to severe chronic plaque-type psoriasis has failed topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues. He was started on methotrexate 25 mg weekly, but after 4 months his plaques improved only marginally and he developed elevated transaminases. He is anxious about further hepatotoxicity risk and requests an alternative oral agent with a favorable safety profile. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Start oral apremilast, a phosphodiesterase 4 inhibitor",
      "Switch to cyclosporine monotherapy",
      "Initiate phototherapy plus topical corticosteroids",
      "Switch to a TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor (e.g., adalimumab)",
      "Start topical tazarotene plus coal tar"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Apremilast is an oral phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor with efficacy similar to methotrexate, making it a reasonable next oral agent for patients who cannot tolerate or have contraindications to methotrexate. Compared to methotrexate, apremilast does not share hepatotoxicity risk. Cyclosporine is not ideal due to its nephrotoxicity and long-term risks, especially since the patient has already had limited response on systemic therapy. Phototherapy and topical agents may be less effective as monotherapy in plaque-type psoriasis of this severity. While a biologic (e.g., TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor) is appropriate for severe or refractory cases, the question specifies a preference for another oral agent. Thus, apremilast is the most suitable next step."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought to dermatology clinic with a history of recurrent skin and soft tissue infections since infancy. On examination, he has numerous pruritic, eczematous plaques mainly involving his face and trunk. Multiple excoriated papules and a few pustules are present. He also has pronounced facial features with a prominent forehead and a broad nasal bridge. His mother mentions that he has had several episodes of pneumonia and oral thrush. Laboratory investigation reveals markedly elevated serum IgE levels, eosinophilia, and a normal neutrophil oxidative burst test. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Severe atopic dermatitis complicated by secondary infection",
      "Job (hyper-IgE) syndrome",
      "Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome",
      "Chronic granulomatous disease",
      "Netherton syndrome"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical features\u2014pruritic eczematous dermatitis, recurrent skin and pulmonary infections (specifically due to S. aureus and Candida species), characteristic facial appearance, and markedly elevated IgE levels\u2014are classic for hyper-IgE syndrome (Job syndrome). Eosinophilia is also commonly seen. A normal neutrophil oxidative burst excludes chronic granulomatous disease. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome presents with thrombocytopenia and immunodeficiency (not elevated IgE levels). Netherton syndrome is characterized by ichthyosis, hair shaft abnormalities, and atopy. Severe atopic dermatitis would not explain the recurrent serious infections and markedly elevated IgE with abnormal facies."

    "question": "A 62-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes presents with the sudden appearance of several large, tense blisters on his lower legs and dorsal feet. The blisters have a nonerythematous base and are not painful. He denies new medications, recent trauma, or a history of autoimmune disease. On examination, the blisters are intact with clear fluid and there is no surrounding inflammation. Biopsy shows subepidermal bullae with minimal inflammation, and direct immunofluorescence (DIF) on perilesional skin is negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Bullous pemphigoid",
      "Bullosis diabeticorum",
      "Lichen planus pemphigoides",
      "Fixed drug eruption",
      "Bullous lichen planus"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Bullosis diabeticorum presents with sudden, tense, noninflammatory blisters, usually on the lower legs or feet, often in patients with diabetes. Histology reveals intra- or subepidermal bullae with little to no inflammation, and DIF is generally negative. This distinguishes it from bullous pemphigoid (which often shows eosinophilic inflammation and positive DIF) and lichen planus-related bullous disorders (which typically have blisters over preexisting lichen planus, or DIF positive for IgM and C3 in colloid bodies). Drug eruptions are more likely to have a history of new medications and often more prominent erythema or necrosis."

She now notes several painful shallow erosions on her palate and inner cheeks, along with a few small round ulcers on the buccal mucosa. On exam, she is febrile and has mild cervical lymphadenopathy. No significant skin rash is present. Several of her classmates have had flu-like symptoms in the past week. Laboratory evaluation reveals a mild leukopenia. Which of the following is the most likely cause of her presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Herpes simplex virus type 1",
      "Parvovirus B19",
      "Coxsackievirus A16",
      "Epstein-Barr virus",
      "Human herpesvirus 6 (HHV-6)"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The key findings are flu-like symptoms followed by intraoral aphthae (palatal erosions and oral ulcers) in a young adult during a seasonal cluster. Parvovirus B19 is known to cause palatal erosions and intraoral aphthae, and often presents with flu-like symptoms peaking in spring and summer in young adults. Herpes simplex typically causes grouped vesicles that may ulcerate but more classically affects the lips and gingiva. Coxsackievirus A16 (hand-foot-mouth disease) is more common in children and is associated with characteristic lesions on the hands and feet. Epstein-Barr virus (mononucleosis) frequently causes pharyngitis and posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, but classic aphthae are not a key feature. HHV-6 causes roseola with high fever and a trunk-centered rash in infants, not enanthem without exanthem in adults."

    "question": "A 24-year-old male backpacker presents to the clinic with a 4-day history of intensely itchy, erythematous papules clustered along his waistline and axillae. He has just returned from hiking and camping in a heavily wooded area in the northeastern United States in late spring. On inspection, several 1-2 mm erythematous wheals are visible, some with tiny central vesicles. Examination reveals a small, dark, oval-shaped arthropod attached to the posterior thigh. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Dermacentor variabilis (American dog tick)",
      "Ixodes scapularis (Black-legged or deer tick)",
      "Rhipicephalus sanguineus (Brown dog tick)",
      "Ornithodoros spp. (Soft tick)",
      "Phthirus pubis (Pubic louse)"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient has a classic exposure history for tick bites, particularly in the northeastern United States during tick season. The description of a small, dark, oval-shaped arthropod is consistent with Ixodes scapularis, or black-legged/deer tick, which is prevalent in this region and attaches to humans during outdoor activities. Dermacentor variabilis is also a tick but is less prevalent in this setting and does not match the described attachment site or geographical risk as closely. Rhipicephalus sanguineus more commonly infests dogs and rarely bites humans; Ornithodoros spp. (soft ticks) are rarely attached for prolonged periods. Phthirus pubis infests pubic and sometimes axillary hair but does not present as an attached tick. Therefore, Ixodes scapularis is the most likely organism."

He reports a recent diagnosis of hypertension and started taking a new antihypertensive medication two months ago. On exam, there are several large, clear, tense bullae on erythematous bases, with some crusted erosions. Oral mucosa is spared. A biopsy shows a subepidermal blister with numerous eosinophils and linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone on direct immunofluorescence. Which of the following medications is most likely responsible for this patient\u2019s skin findings?",

    "explanation": "This scenario describes clinical and pathological features of bullous pemphigoid, which can be drug-induced. Bullous pemphigoid presents as tense bullae on erythematous skin in older adults; oral involvement is rare. Histology shows a subepidermal blister with eosinophils and linear IgG/C3 at the basement membrane on immunofluorescence. Several drugs, including loop and thiazide diuretics (like hydrochlorothiazide), are known triggers. The other listed drugs are not commonly implicated in bullous pemphigoid."

Direct immunofluorescence is performed, but the specimen was taken from the center of a bullous lesion. The immunofluorescence study is nondiagnostic. Which change in biopsy technique is most appropriate to maximize diagnostic yield in this setting?",
    "choices": [
      "Repeat biopsy from the perilesional skin within 1 cm from a fresh blister",
      "Repeat biopsy from the central, fully formed blister",
      "Repeat biopsy from involved skin at the edge of a new blister",

      "Repeat biopsy from normal-appearing skin at least 2 cm from the nearest lesion"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "For most blistering diseases, including bullous pemphigoid (the most likely diagnosis here), direct immunofluorescence is most diagnostic when taken from perilesional skin, specifically within 1 cm of the blister, because this area contains the highest concentration of immune reactants before destruction by blister formation occurs. Biopsying from the center of the blister may lead to a loss of diagnostic material, as the epitope-antibody complexes may have been disrupted or lost due to tissue destruction."

The lesions are intensely pruritic, eventually ulcerate, and heal with characteristic varioliform scars. The episodes are restricted to the sunny months and are triggered by short exposures to sunlight. The child is otherwise healthy, with no family history of photosensitivity disorders, and is not taking any medications. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Polymorphous light eruption",
      "Hydroa vacciniforme",
      "Porphyria cutanea tarda",
      "Exogenous photodermatitis",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Hydroa vacciniforme classically presents in childhood with recurrent pruritic vesicles and papules on sun-exposed skin (especially the face and hands), evolving into ulcerations and healing with varioliform (pox-like) scars. Episodes typically begin in spring or summer and resolve in adolescence. Options such as polymorphous light eruption (more common, but typically without varioliform scarring), porphyria cutanea tarda (blisters, hypertrichosis, and milia, often in adults), exogenous photodermatitis (history of drug or chemical exposure), and lupus erythematosus (often associated with systemic symptoms and persistent plaques) are inconsistent with this scenario."

The lesions first appeared a year ago and have gradually increased in size. He works with river dolphins and often swims in freshwater rivers. Examination reveals firm, skin-colored nodules with a smooth surface, some of which are coalescing into plaques. Skin biopsy reveals chains of thick-walled, yeast-like cells connected by narrow bridges, resembling a 'string of pearls.' Fungal culture is unsuccessful. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial therapeutic intervention for this patient's condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Oral itraconazole for 6 months",

A biopsy is performed, which reveals epidermal necrosis, marked ballooning degeneration of keratinocytes, massive papillary dermal edema, interface changes, and both cytoplasmic and nuclear inclusions. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Molluscum contagiosum",

The histopathology showing epidermal necrosis, ballooning of keratinocytes, massive papillary dermal edema, interface change, and cytoplasmic/nuclear inclusions is characteristic for Orf. Molluscum contagiosum would feature cup-shaped lesions and Henderson-Paterson bodies, which are not described here. Cutaneous anthrax presents with a different clinical evolution and does not fit the given histology. Cowpox/Milker\u2019s nodule may have identical features, but epidemiology (sheep exposure) supports Orf over cow exposure.

On examination, you note numerous erythematous, gritty, ill-defined plaques with adherent scale, but no ulceration or induration is present. He is otherwise well, with no history of immunosuppression. Which molecular event best explains the pathogenesis of this patient's skin lesions?",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient's history and findings are classic for actinic keratoses (AKs): rough, scaly patches in chronically sun-exposed skin of a fair-skinned, older adult. The key pathogenic event is UVB-induced DNA damage that forms thymidine dimers, leading to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 within keratinocytes. This impairs cell cycle regulation and promotes carcinogenesis. Activation of BRAF is seen in melanocytic lesions, hyperplasia from friction refers to different keratoses, and CDKN2A loss is more relevant to melanoma, while melanocyte stimulating hormone overexpression is unrelated to actinic keratosis."

      "Delayed blistering and milia on the hands and face after sun exposure, with hypertrichosis.",
      "Elevated urinary porphobilinogen and severe abdominal pain episodes.",
      "Evidence of chronic liver disease and pigmented gallstones on abdominal ultrasound.",
      "Marked purpura in exposed skin following blue light phototherapy as a neonate with a history of blood transfusion.",
      "Extensive bullous lesions within minutes of sun exposure, with mucosal involvement."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This child has classic features of erythropoietic protoporphyria (EPP): immediate pain/pruritus with sun exposure, visible light sensitivity (symptoms through window glass), and a weather-beaten photodistributed rash. EPP is associated with ferrochelatase deficiency leading to elevated protoporphyrin IX. Because protoporphyrin is excreted in the bile and accumulates in the liver, patients can develop chronic liver disease and pigmented (protoporphyrin) gallstones. Thus, option 3 is correct. The other options describe features of other porphyrias (for example, PCT, AIP) or different photosensitivity syndromes."

    "question": "A 3-week-old female infant is brought to the dermatologist for evaluation of skin lesions that appeared at birth. Her mother reports that the lesions first appeared as blisters, then became warty over the next few weeks. Now, the infant has hyperpigmented macules in a swirling and linear distribution along her trunk and limbs, which follow the lines of Blaschko. She also has a history of abnormal dentition, areas of alopecia on the scalp vertex, and nail dystrophy. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be present in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Congenital heart disease",
      "Hypohidrosis and normal skin pigmentation",
      "Seizures and retinal vascular anomalies",
      "Peripheral polyneuropathy",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This vignette describes the classic progression and features of incontinentia pigmenti (IP), a disorder due to a NEMO (IKBKG) gene defect. IP manifests in four characteristic stages (vesicular, verrucous, hyperpigmented, hypopigmented) following the lines of Blaschko and presents with extracutaneous findings including abnormal dentition, nail dystrophy, alopecia, neurologic involvement (like seizures/mental retardation), and eye anomalies (keratitis, retinal vascular anomalies). Option C is the correct answer. Hypohidrosis with normal pigmentation is seen in the allelic disorder hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, not IP (Choice B). The other choices are not associated with IP."

    "question": "A 27-year-old man presents with a five-day history of painful genital ulcers and tender, fluctuant swelling in the right groin. On examination, there is a 1cm ulcer with undermined edges and purulent base on the penile shaft, and a tender inguinal mass with a groove separating enlarged nodes above and below the inguinal ligament (the 'groove sign'). He has recently returned from traveling in Southeast Asia. Serologic testing is positive by complement fixation. Which of the following is the most appropriate first-line treatment?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Azithromycin",
      "B) Ceftriaxone",
      "C) Ciprofloxacin",
      "D) Doxycycline",
      "E) Erythromycin"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes chancroid with classic 'groove sign' of inguinal lymphadenopathy and painful genital ulcers, common after travel to endemic regions. The first-line treatments for chancroid are ceftriaxone or azithromycin, but ceftriaxone IV is specifically recommended according to the reference. Doxycycline and erythromycin are more associated with other ulcerative STIs such as lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), while ciprofloxacin can be used but is not first-line. Thus, the best answer is ceftriaxone."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man develops several tense blisters on his abdomen and groin. On examination, the blisters are large and filled with clear fluid, arising on an erythematous base without mucosal involvement. A skin biopsy shows subepidermal clefting with an inflammatory infiltrate rich in eosinophils. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin shows linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone. Which of the following findings is most likely if indirect immunofluorescence is performed on salt-split skin using the patient\u2019s serum?",
    "choices": [
      "IgG staining exclusively on the epidermal side (roof) of the split",
      "IgG staining exclusively on the dermal side (floor) of the split",

      "No staining detected",
      "Cytoplasmic IgA staining in basal keratinocytes"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This is classic bullous pemphigoid, which presents with subepidermal blisters, linear IgG and C3 along the basement membrane, and no mucosal involvement. When indirect immunofluorescence is performed on salt-split skin for bullous pemphigoid, IgG binds to the epidermal side (roof) of the split. This distinguishes it from diseases like epidermolysis bullosa acquisita and some cases of mucous membrane pemphigoid, which show dermal side (floor) staining."

    "question": "A dermatology practice is implementing a quality improvement project aiming to reduce post-operative complications for patients undergoing excisional surgery for melanoma. The team considers three different metrics to assess the project\u2019s effectiveness: (1) the percentage of patients who return for an annual skin exam after surgery, (2) the rate of surgical site infections, and (3) the number of adverse reactions to preoperative antibiotics. Which statement most accurately matches each metric to its appropriate measure type?",
    "choices": [
      "(A) All three metrics are outcome measures, since they quantify patient-centered results.",
      "(B) (1) is an outcome measure; (2) is a process measure; (3) is a balancing measure.",

      "(E) (1) is a process measure; (2) is a balancing measure; (3) is an outcome measure."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "According to the reference, 'percentage of melanoma patients with annual skin exam' is a process measure (it assesses whether a recommended action is being followed), 'percentage of surgical site infections' is an outcome measure (it assesses the effect of care on the patient), and 'number of adverse reactions to preoperative antibiotics' is a balancing measure (it assesses unintended consequences elsewhere of a change meant to improve another outcome). Thus, (1) is process, (2) is outcome, and (3) is balancing, making (C) the correct answer."

On examination, there is a friable, polypoid mass attached to the nasal mucosa. Biopsy of the lesion reveals numerous very large (100-400 \u00b5m), thick-walled sporangia filled with endospores, with surrounding granulomatous inflammation. Which of the following organisms is the most likely cause of this presentation?",
    "choices": [

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The described organism with enormous sporangia (100-400 \u00b5m) containing numerous endospores and associated with granulomatous inflammation is characteristic of Rhinosporidium seeberi. This contrasts with Coccidioides (smaller spherules), Blastomyces (broad-based budding yeast), Cryptococcus (gelatinous capsule), and Histoplasma (intracellular yeast). The clinical scenario also matches rhinosporidiosis, which commonly affects nasal mucosa in people with exposure to stagnant water in endemic regions."

She reports localized swelling, with occasional tenderness but no systemic symptoms. On examination, the area is non-erythematous, mildly indurated, and not fluctuant. An excisional biopsy reveals numerous basophilic, calcified spheres in the dermis, surrounded by a granulomatous inflammatory infiltrate. The lesion appears distinctly radiopaque on a recent facial X-ray. Which of the following is the most likely material used as the dermal filler?",
    "choices": [
      "Hyaluronic acid",
      "Silicone",
      "Poly-L-lactic acid",
      "Calcium hydroxylapatite",

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The histopathologic finding of basophilic, calcified spheres in the dermis with surrounding granulomatous inflammation, along with radiopacity on imaging, is most specific for calcium hydroxylapatite filler. Hyaluronic acid does not show calcified spheres or radiopacity. Silicone would present as cystic spaces or vacuoles in the reticular dermis and is not radiopaque. Poly-L-lactic acid induces a granulomatous response but does not form calcified spheres or appear radiopaque. Autologous fat does not show these features either."

Over the preceding 2 months, he noticed that the lesions rapidly worsened and began involving the oral mucosa. He has unintentionally lost 10 kg in the last 3 months and reports early satiety. On examination, you observe pronounced papillomatous hyperkeratosis in the flexural areas and noted involvement of the lips and tongue with similar velvety papules. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Start topical tretinoin to improve the skin appearance and review in 6 months",
      "Order laboratory studies to screen for undiagnosed diabetes mellitus",
      "Reassure the patient; findings are consistent with benign acanthosis nigricans associated with obesity",
      "Arrange urgent gastrointestinal malignancy workup, especially upper GI endoscopy",
      "Refer for long-pulsed alexandrite laser treatment of the plaques"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes malignant acanthosis nigricans, characterized by rapid onset, significant mucosal involvement, and associated systemic symptoms (weight loss, early satiety). These findings suggest a paraneoplastic syndrome, most commonly associated with underlying gastrointestinal malignancy (particularly gastric adenocarcinoma). Urgent investigation for malignancy, such as arranging an upper GI endoscopy, is the most appropriate next step. Topical therapies, laser, and reassurance are not appropriate in the context of suspected malignancy; while diabetes screening is reasonable in benign cases, this clinical picture points to a much more urgent issue."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of fever and the development of numerous pruritic, erythematous papules and vesicles on the trunk and extremities. He recently returned from an extended stay in rural Brazil, where he spent time swimming in freshwater lakes. Some lesions have evolved into tense bullae with surrounding urticarial plaques. He denies new medications, and there is no history of atopic dermatitis. On examination, there is excoriation of some vesicles and no mucosal involvement. KOH examination from a blister is negative for hyphae. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism of his cutaneous eruption?",
    "choices": [
      "Schistosoma mansoni (helminth)",
      "Sarcoptes scabiei (ectoparasite)",
      "Strongyloides stercoralis (nematode)",
      "Leishmania braziliensis (protozoan)",
      "Histoplasma capsulatum (fungus)"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes a swimmer's itch (cercarial dermatitis), commonly caused by penetration of Schistosoma cercariae (helminth parasites) in freshwater. This produces a pruritic vesicular or bullous eruption on exposed skin, especially after freshwater exposure in endemic areas like rural Brazil. The absence of hyphae on KOH excludes a dermatophyte infection, and there is no mention of burrows or web-space involvement typical of scabies. Strongyloides and Leishmania have different cutaneous presentations, and Histoplasma usually causes systemic, not primary bullous, disease."

He has previously used methotrexate and anti-TNF therapy, with partial responses (PASI-75 never achieved). He is otherwise healthy. He asks about new systemic therapies with the highest chance of achieving significant clinical improvement. Which of the following biologic agents is most likely to achieve PASI-75 for this patient, based on current efficacy data?",
    "choices": [
      "Etanercept (anti-TNF)",
      "Guselkumab (anti-IL-23 p40)",

      "Spesolimab (anti-IL-36 receptor)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "IL-17 inhibitors, particularly bimekizumab (which targets both IL-17A and IL-17F), have demonstrated superior efficacy in psoriasis with PASI-75 achieved in ~80% of patients, outperforming anti-TNF and anti\u2013IL-12/23 or IL-23 biologics (which achieve PASI-75 in only 50\u201365% of cases). Spesolimab is approved for pustular psoriasis, not plaque psoriasis, and the IL-23 inhibitors (guselkumab, tildrakizumab) are effective but generally do not reach the same rates of PASI-75 as IL-17 inhibitors."

Some lesions are fluctuant and draining, while others have healed with scars. Examination reveals multiple tender nodules, draining sinuses, and hypertrophic scarring. Several areas show double-headed open comedones. The patient reports increased frequency of episodes and progressive scarring over the last year. Which of the following features is most specific for her underlying diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Malodorous, recurrent abscesses in intertriginous areas",

      "Unpredictable clinical course with variable severity"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "While many conditions can cause recurrent abscesses, draining sinuses, scarring, and predominantly affect women of young adulthood, the presence of double or multiheaded open comedones is most specific to hidradenitis suppurativa (HS). This feature, particularly in long-standing disease, is a hallmark that distinguishes HS from other chronic inflammatory conditions and infections involving intertriginous skin."

He has no fever or lymphadenopathy. On examination, there is a single, well-demarcated, shallow ulcer with a fibrinous base and minimal surrounding erythema. Biopsy of the lesion shows large atypical cells positive for CD20 and EBER (EBV-encoded RNA) with a dense inflammatory background. PET-CT scan is negative for systemic involvement. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Classic oral squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer",
      "Lymphomatoid granulomatosis involving the mucosa",
      "Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma",
      "HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Epstein-Barr virus-positive mucocutaneous ulcer presents as a localized, shallow, well-circumscribed ulcer in immunosuppressed individuals, most frequently involving oral mucosa. It is EBER positive and indolent, distinguishing it from other aggressive lymphomas and malignancies. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis typically presents with nodular, often ulcerated lesions involving lungs and skin, not limited, shallow ulcers. HTLV-1-associated adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma has different systemic features and immunophenotype and is not associated with isolated oral ulcers."

On examination, there is a firm, hyperkeratotic, ulcerated nodule with crusting. The lesion bleeds easily on minor trauma. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy. He is otherwise healthy, but reports a history of persistent perioral HPV infection. Which of the following features places this patient at highest risk for aggressive or metastatic disease?",
    "choices": [
      "History of actinic keratosis in the area",
      "Involvement of the lower lip location",

      "Previous treatment with topical immunosuppressants"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) on the lower lip is considered high-risk due to its aggressive potential, higher rates of local recurrence, and increased risk of metastasis, especially to regional lymph nodes. Location on the lower lip is a well-recognized high-risk feature regardless of lymph node findings or the presence of prior actinic keratoses. While ulceration and bleeding are common in SCCs, they are not sufficient alone to define aggressive potential without context of high-risk anatomical site, such as the lower lip."

His past medical history is notable for frequent respiratory infections. On further questioning, his mother reports that he is highly sensitive to sunlight and that several relatives have had malignancies at young ages. Physical examination reveals multiple caf\u00e9-au-lait macules, mild hypertrichosis, and evidence of chronic lung disease. Laboratory tests reveal hypogammaglobulinemia. Which of the following malignancies is this patient at greatest risk of developing?",
    "choices": [

      "Basal cell carcinoma",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Hepatocellular carcinoma",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical description of an ill-defined bruised lesion in an elderly individual, especially on the scalp and face, expanding over months, is classic for angiosarcoma. Histologically, angiosarcoma shows highly atypical, pleomorphic endothelial cells forming irregular slit-like channels containing red blood cells. Kaposi's sarcoma also shows slit-like vascular spaces but in the setting of immunocompromised individuals, often with more spindle cell proliferation and less cytologic atypia. The response is not typical of benign vascular proliferations like tufted angioma or papillary endothelial hyperplasia, and Dabska-like tumors are less aggressive, typically affect children, and have distinctive hobnail endothelial cells."

It recurs each summer following sun exposure. Mucosal involvement (typical of actinic prurigo) and eczematous lesions (typical of juvenile spring eruption and PMLE in young children) are not seen. Classic PMLE does not heal with scarring or present with vesicles/bullae regularly. Atopic dermatitis is not induced by sun exposure in this pattern."

    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes scombroid poisoning, which follows ingestion of fish (especially scombroid species like tuna) that has been improperly stored, allowing bacteria to convert histidine in the flesh to histamine. Symptoms (flush, urticarial-like rash without wheals, GI upset) occur rapidly after ingestion, can affect multiple individuals, and mimic an allergic reaction but are due to histamine toxicity. There is no true IgE-mediated reaction, and no involvement of neurotoxin (which would require a sting), ciguatera (which features neurological symptoms), or contact with cyanobacteria (which would cause dermatitis at skin-contact sites, not after eating fish)."

Familial cylindromatosis (choice 4) may also present with multiple cylindromas, but Brooke-Spiegler syndrome is distinguished by the additional coexistence of trichoepitheliomas and spiradenomas. Birt-Hogg-Dub\u00e9 and Gardner syndromes do not show this combination of skin findings, and Rombo syndrome features atrophoderma, milia, and basal cell carcinomas rather than cylindromas."

    "question": "A 63-year-old man with a 40 pack-year smoking history presents with several weeks of rapidly progressing, tender, violaceous plaques on his lower extremities. Physical examination reveals multiple ulcerated, infiltrated plaques with undermined borders and an irregular, serpiginous configuration. He also reports recent unintentional weight loss. Biopsy shows dense neutrophilic infiltrate with sterile dermal abscesses. There is no evidence of infection on tissue cultures. Which of the following internal malignancies is most characteristically associated with this cutaneous finding?",
    "choices": [
      "Colorectal adenocarcinoma",
      "Prostate adenocarcinoma",
      "Renal cell carcinoma",
      "Acute myeloid leukemia",
      "Small cell lung carcinoma"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes pyoderma gangrenosum, a neutrophilic dermatosis notable for rapidly progressing ulcers with undermined borders and associated systemic symptoms. Although pyoderma gangrenosum can be seen alongside various conditions, there is a well-recognized association between pyoderma gangrenosum and hematologic malignancies, particularly acute myeloid leukemia. Solid organ tumors such as colorectal, prostate, renal, or lung cancers are less commonly linked to pyoderma gangrenosum. Thus, acute myeloid leukemia (choice 4) is the most characteristic association in this context."

    "question": "A 43-year-old man with AIDS presents with blurred vision and floaters in his right eye. He is known to have a history of CMV retinitis that has progressed despite adequate therapy with ganciclovir and foscarnet. He is started on a new intravenous antiviral agent. Shortly after, he develops symptoms of nephrotoxicity and ocular discomfort; examination reveals a mild iritis. Which of the following drugs is most likely responsible for these adverse effects?",
    "choices": [
      "Acyclovir",
      "Cidofovir",
      "Abacavir",
      "Zidovudine",
      "Oseltamivir"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Cidofovir is used for CMV retinitis in patients with AIDS who have failed treatment with both ganciclovir and foscarnet. It is also useful for HSV or VZV infections resistant to acyclovir. Typical adverse effects include nephrotoxicity, iritis, and gastrointestinal disturbances. The other options do not match the clinical scenario or adverse effect profile."

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents with a persistent, violaceous, broken, and irregular net-like discoloration on her lower abdomen and thighs, which does not resolve with warming. Over the past year she has experienced intermittent episodes of confusion and one transient right-sided weakness that resolved in 24 hours. Her blood pressure is labile, fluctuating between hypertensive and normal readings. She has no known family history of autoimmune or clotting disorders. Laboratory evaluation is negative for anti-nuclear antibodies and antiphospholipid antibodies. A skin biopsy of the affected area reveals non-inflammatory thrombotic occlusion of small- to medium-sized arteries in the dermis. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome",
      "Sneddon\u2019s syndrome",
      "Livedoid vasculitis (atrophie blanche)",
      "Polyarteritis nodosa",
      "Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient presents with persistent, widespread livedo racemosa (broken, irregular net-like pattern that does not disappear) and CNS events (transient ischemic attack, confusion), along with labile hypertension, which are classic features of Sneddon\u2019s syndrome. Blood tests were negative for antiphospholipid antibodies and ANA, making antiphospholipid antibody syndrome less likely. Livedoid vasculitis/atrophie blanche causes painful lower leg ulcers and white stellate scars, not widespread fixed livedo with CNS involvement. Polyarteritis nodosa generally causes more systemic and organ-threatening features. Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus typically presents with scarring and photosensitive lesions, not livedo racemosa and CNS events."

    "question": "A 38-year-old man presents to your dermatology clinic with progressive hair loss in the vertex scalp consistent with androgenetic alopecia. He is considering surgical hair restoration. On examination, he has significant loss in the central scalp but good density in the occipital and parietal regions. He wishes to minimize visible scarring due to his preference for wearing his hair closely cropped. He also expresses concern about a natural look over the coming decades, as his father had significant hair loss by his late fifties. Which of the following is the most appropriate counseling point regarding the optimal procedural choice?",
    "choices": [
      "Follicular unit transplantation (FUT) is preferred because it leaves no visible scarring and provides the most natural look as alopecia progresses.",
      "Follicular unit extraction (FUE) is optimal for minimizing visible scarring when hair is cut short, but transplantation to the vertex may lead to unnatural hair distribution as alopecia progresses.",
      "FUE is less time consuming than FUT for both extraction and graft creation, making it the best option for all patients.",
      "FUT is less likely to result in follicular transection and therefore best preserves graft viability regardless of hairstyle preferences.",
      "Combining FUE and FUT is universally recommended to accommodate both natural results and reduced scarring, regardless of individual alopecia patterns."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "FUE is preferred for patients who wish to minimize visible scarring as it typically results in 'white dots' that are usually inconspicuous with short hairstyles. However, androgenetic alopecia is progressive; transplantation into areas like the vertex may, over time, result in unnatural looking hair patterns as native hair continues to be lost, leading to islands of transplanted hair. Patients must be counseled regarding the likelihood of future hair loss and its impact on appearance after hair transplantation. FUT results in a linear scar, more noticeable if the patient wears hair short. FUE is more time consuming in extraction but less so in graft creation. Neither combining techniques nor FUT alone eliminates concerns about progressive alopecia causing unnatural results."

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes classic chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (DLE): well-demarcated, scaly plaques with central hypopigmentation (which can result from atrophy), follicular plugging, and scarring alopecia, especially on the face and scalp. While photosensitivity and oral ulcers are common in LE, the lack of significant systemic involvement, negative anti-dsDNA, and normal urine all point away from systemic lupus. DLE (a type of chronic cutaneous LE) has this pattern and can be differentiated from subacute cutaneous lupus (which shows annular or papulosquamous lesions with minimal scarring), acute cutaneous lupus (which presents as a malar rash with no scarring), and dermatomyositis (which has a different cutaneous pattern and associated muscle weakness). Lichen planus\u2013lupus overlap would show features of both diseases, which is not described here."

He reports easy bruising and purpura after minor trauma. He also notes recent fatigue and weight loss. Physical examination confirms periorbital purpura ('raccoon eyes') and macroglossia. A skin biopsy from a lesion stains positive with Congo red, appearing orange-red under light microscopy and showing green birefringence on polarized light. Which of the following additional findings is most likely to be seen in this patient based on the underlying pathophysiology?",
    "choices": [
      "Nephrotic syndrome due to glomerular amyloid deposition",

    "explanation": "This patient has cutaneous findings of systemic amyloidosis (macroglossia, periorbital purpura, waxy papules/plaques), confirmed by Congo red staining with green birefringence on polarized light. Amyloid is deposited in multiple organs. The kidney is a common target, where amyloid deposition in the glomerulus leads to nephrotic syndrome (proteinuria, edema). Other answer choices do not reflect the multisystem protein deposition characteristic of amyloidosis."

He reports recent onset of dysphagia and joint stiffness in his hands and elbows. There is no history of sclerodactyly, Raynaud\u2019s phenomenon, or digital ulcers. Physical examination reveals indurated skin with linear arrangement of papules and decreased range of motion in affected joints, but no evidence of calcinosis, telangiectasia, or digital ulceration. Laboratory studies reveal a monoclonal IgG\u03bb spike on serum protein electrophoresis. Skin biopsy shows increased dermal collagen, mucin deposition, and proliferation of fibroblasts. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "This patient\u2019s presentation of waxy, linearly arranged papules with induration producing a leonine facies, systemic involvement (dysphagia, arthritis), and a monoclonal IgG\u03bb paraproteinemia are classic for scleromyxedema. Histology revealing increased dermal collagen, mucin, and fibroblast proliferation confirms the diagnosis. There is no evidence of amyloid, criteria for systemic sclerosis, cryoglobulinemic features, or muscle weakness/rash suggestive of dermatomyositis."

He has no personal or family history of malignancy. Dermoscopic examination reveals arborizing vessels but no pigmentation. Excision biopsy demonstrates a well-circumscribed neoplasm composed of nests of basaloid cells showing peripheral palisading and small keratin cysts. There is no evidence of mitotic activity or invasion into surrounding tissue. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Basal cell carcinoma",

      "Sebaceous carcinoma",
      "Pilomatricoma",
      "Syringoma"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Trichoblastoma is a benign follicular adnexal neoplasm that can clinically resemble basal cell carcinoma (BCC), especially on the scalp. Histologically, it features well-circumscribed nests of basaloid cells, peripheral palisading, and sometimes keratin cysts, but lacks the mitotic activity, stromal retraction, or invasive nature seen in BCC. Arborizing vessels can be seen in both BCC and trichoblastoma, but the absence of atypia and invasion, as well as the presence of follicular differentiation, support trichoblastoma in this scenario."

He reports that the oral ulcers appeared first, followed by skin lesions that vary in appearance\u2014some are erythematous papules, others are lichenoid or targetoid, and a few have developed into flaccid bullae. On examination, there are widespread erosions on the oral mucosa, polymorphous skin lesions, and several flaccid bullae. A skin biopsy reveals suprabasilar acantholysis, dyskeratotic keratinocytes, and basal vacuolar change. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrates both intercellular IgG and C3 as well as linear/granular deposition at the dermoepidermal junction. Which autoantibodies are most likely to be present in this patient?",

Autoantibodies in paraneoplastic pemphigus are directed against a variety of antigens, notably envoplakin, periplakin, desmoplakin (I and II), BPAg1, desmoglein 1 and 3, and plectin. Traditional pemphigus vulgaris, in contrast, is limited to desmoglein 1 and 3 (choice A). BP (choice B) targets BP180 and BP230.

Laboratory studies reveal a markedly elevated serum IgE level. Which of the following best explains the pathophysiology underlying his cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Failure of IgA production at mucosal surfaces, allowing colonization by staphylococci and streptococci.",
      "Excessive IgM-mediated complement fixation causing tissue damage in the superficial dermis.",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient\u2019s atopic dermatitis, history of atopy, and elevated IgE point to a classic atopic pathogenesis. IgE binds allergens and interacts with high-affinity receptors on mast cells. When triggered by specific antigens, mast cells degranulate, releasing histamine and other inflammatory mediators, resulting in pruritus and eczematous lesions. This is the hallmark pathophysiologic process in atopic dermatitis."

He denies any prior skin cancers or trauma in the area. A biopsy is performed, and histopathology reveals small blue round cells with scant cytoplasm and frequent mitoses arranged in trabecular patterns. Immunohistochemistry is positive for cytokeratin 20 in a perinuclear dot pattern and negative for S-100, Melan-A, and CD34. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",

      "Order a full-body PET/CT scan and refer to oncology without further local treatment."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient's lesion is consistent with Merkel cell carcinoma, as indicated by the clinical presentation, histology, and cytokeratin 20 perinuclear dot pattern. Merkel cell carcinoma is an aggressive cutaneous neuroendocrine malignancy requiring precise surgical excision. Mohs micrographic surgery is the preferred treatment to ensure complete clearance of tumor with maximal tissue preservation and assessment of 100% of tumor margins, crucial given the tumor's high recurrence risk. Wide local excision is alternative but less effective for margin control. Topical or antibiotic therapies are not appropriate, and staging scans are important but do not replace the need for definitive local treatment."

The ulcer bed has a granulating appearance and is not overtly infected. The patient has no significant past medical history. A biopsy of the wound edge reveals upregulation of MHC class II expression, marked infiltration of macrophages, and increased local IFN-\u03b3 levels. Which of the following cell types is primarily responsible for the activation of macrophages in this phase of wound healing?",
    "choices": [
      "Neutrophils",
      "Cytotoxic (CD8+) T cells",
      "TH2 (helper T type 2) cells",
      "TH1 (helper T type 1) cells",
      "B cells"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "During wound healing, especially as inflammation shifts towards tissue regeneration and remodeling, macrophages are activated to clear debris and orchestrate repair. This activation is mainly driven by IFN-\u03b3, which is produced primarily by TH1 helper T cells. TH1 cells promote a cell-mediated immune response, leading to macrophage activation (classical/M1 pathway), increased microbicidal activity, and upregulation of MHC expression. This is distinct from the effects of TH2 cells or B cells, which are more involved in humoral immunity and antibody production. Neutrophils and cytotoxic T cells are not the main sources of IFN-\u03b3-mediated macrophage activation in cutaneous wound healing."

Some lesions have ulcerated, and a few have left atrophic, depressed scars. He has no history of trauma, fever, or drug exposure, but reports that his job as a truck driver includes frequent, prolonged road trips across Central America. He has mild bilateral pitting edema and scattered varicosities on examination. Biopsy of a nodule reveals a predominantly lobular panniculitis with mixed inflammatory infiltrate, focal granuloma formation, vasculitis of small vessels, and fat necrosis. Special stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi are negative. Laboratory studies, including CBC and liver function, are unremarkable. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "The clinical picture of recurrent, tender, ulcerated and atrophic nodules on the posterior lower legs in an individual with risk factors for venous stasis, and histology showing a mostly lobular panniculitis with granulomas and vasculitis (without evidence of infection), most closely fits erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis). This condition is associated with chronic venous insufficiency and sometimes tuberculosis (though stains for infectious organisms are negative here). The location, scarring, and histopathology are not consistent with erythema nodosum (which is typically septal and non-ulcerating), or with the other listed options."

Histologically, the lesion is found to be located entirely within the dermis, composed of short bundles of spindle cells separated by artifactual clefting, and has a 'thumbprint' appearance on low power. There is no significant involvement of the subcutaneous tissue, encapsulation is not evident, and the lesion stains strongly for S100 protein. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Schwannoma (neurilemmoma)",
      "Traumatic neuroma",
      "Palisaded encapsulated neuroma",
      "Supernumerary digit",
      "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP)"

    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is Palisaded encapsulated neuroma (option 3). This lesion is well-circumscribed but nonencapsulated (the name is a misnomer), and histologically shows short fascicles of spindle cells with artifactual clefting, creating a 'thumbprint' appearance. It is S100 positive due to Schwann cell differentiation. Schwannoma would be encapsulated, deeper, and show Antoni A and B areas with Verocay bodies. Traumatic neuroma would show a haphazard arrangement in a scar. Supernumerary digit has a different clinical setting. DFSP is CD34 positive, not S100."

    "question": "A 27-year-old woman presents with a rapidly spreading, erythematous, tender plaque on her right cheek that developed two days after a minor scratch. She has no significant medical history. Laboratory studies reveal a normal white blood cell count. A skin biopsy demonstrates superficial and deep perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate with scattered eosinophils and minimal epidermal involvement. Immunohistochemistry shows an abundance of CD4+ T cells. Considering the underlying immunopathology, which of the following best explains how helper T cells are activated to participate in the inflammatory process seen in this condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Binding of T cell receptor to antigen presented by MHC alone",
      "Engagement of CD28 on T cells with B7 on antigen presenting cells, in addition to TCR-MHC interaction",
      "Direct recognition of antigens without need for co-stimulation",
      "Migration of mature T cells from the thymus to peripheral tissues upon antigen exposure",
      "Inhibition of T cell activation by CTLA-4 binding to B7, leading to checkpoint blockade"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Activation of helper T cells (CD4+) requires two signals: the first is binding of the T cell receptor (TCR) to antigen presented by an MHC molecule on an antigen presenting cell (APC), and the second is co-stimulatory signaling, primarily involving CD28 on the T cell binding to B7 on the APC. Without this second co-stimulatory signal, the T cell becomes anergic and does not fully activate, thereby preventing an immune response. In the clinical scenario, the inflammatory process is sustained by activated CD4+ T cells, indicating that both activation signals were present. Choice 1 is incorrect because MHC-TCR binding alone is insufficient for activation; choice 3 is incorrect because co-stimulation is required; choice 4 describes T cell development and migration, not activation; choice 5 describes inhibition of T cell activation, not the activation itself."

      "Mohs micrographic surgery",
      "Radiation therapy",
      "Topical imiquimod"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Mohs micrographic surgery is optimal in this scenario due to its highest cure rates, particularly for recurrent tumors (approximately 95% compared to about 80% with standard excision), and its precision in margin control with maximal tissue conservation. This is especially important on the nasal ala, where tissue preservation and cosmesis are crucial. Standard excision has a higher recurrence risk in previously treated or recurrent tumors, and the other options either have lower efficacy or are not first-line for recurrent BCC, especially in cosmetically sensitive sites."

The lesion is characterized by an expanding erythematous rash with central clearing ('bull's-eye' or target lesion) at the site of the tick bite, often accompanied by mild constitutional symptoms. Erythema marginatum (A) is associated with rheumatic fever and has a distinctive, non-expanding, serpiginous appearance. Cellulitis (B) and erysipelas (D) usually present as poorly demarcated or sharply demarcated non-bullseye erythematous plaques, respectively, often with more pronounced systemic symptoms.

They present as violaceous, edematous macules, papules, and plaques with swelling over the acral surfaces, in the absence of clear cold exposure. The history of preceding viral symptoms, acral involvement, and absence of mucosal lesions fit this diagnosis best. Erythema multiforme usually involves target lesions and often mucosal surfaces. Pityriasis rosea-like eruptions present differently and varicella is associated with a vesicular, centripetal rash. Classic pernio is triggered by cold, which is not present here."

In immunosuppressed and transplant patients with regional lymph node involvement, checkpoint inhibitors like pembrolizumab are considered even with comorbidities, as systemic chemotherapy has poorer long-term outcomes and significant toxicity. While surgery and radiation are mainstays for localized disease, advanced or nodal disease requires systemic therapy. Mohs and acitretin are not established treatments for MCC."

    "question": "A 19-year-old woman presents with a painless, slow-growing, subcutaneous nodule over her left lower leg. She has no systemic symptoms. On exam, the nodule is well-circumscribed, soft, and located deep in the dermis. Surgical excision reveals a cyst with a lining of cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells bearing cilia, and the cyst lumen contains cellular debris. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Epidermal inclusion cyst",
      "Cutaneous ciliated cyst",
      "Branchial cleft cyst",
      "Median raphe cyst",
      "Thyroglossal duct cyst"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a young woman with a painless subcutaneous cyst on the lower extremity. Histologically, the cyst is lined by ciliated cuboidal or columnar epithelium and contains debris. This is characteristic of a cutaneous ciliated cyst, which most commonly occurs on the lower extremities of women. Other options are incorrect: epidermal inclusion cysts have a squamous epithelium lining; branchial cleft cysts occur in the lateral neck and are lined by respiratory epithelium; median raphe cysts are midline anogenital lesions and may rarely be ciliated; thyroglossal duct cysts occur in the neck midline and feature thyroid follicles."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man with long-standing hypertension and diabetes is admitted to the hospital with a new-onset purpuric rash on his lower legs. He reports a 3-day history of fever, malaise, and arthralgias. Medications include lisinopril, metformin, and he recently completed a course of amoxicillin-clavulanate for sinusitis. Examination reveals palpable, non-blanching purpura and some small, ulcerated papules along the lower extremities. Laboratory studies show mild leukocytosis, elevated CRP, and urinalysis with microhematuria. A skin biopsy is performed, revealing leukocytoclastic vasculitis involving small dermal blood vessels. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrates IgA deposition in vessel walls. Which of the following is the most likely underlying etiology for his presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura (IgA vasculitis) secondary to recent upper respiratory infection",
      "Drug-induced small-vessel vasculitis triggered by antibiotic exposure",
      "Septic emboli from endocarditis",
      "Cryoglobulinemic vasculitis associated with hepatitis C",
      "Antiphospholipid antibody syndrome"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes a classic case of IgA vasculitis (Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura) in an adult, with palpable purpura, arthralgias, and renal findings, and histopathology revealing leukocytoclastic vasculitis with IgA deposition. Although drug-induced vasculitis is possible (particularly with new antibiotic exposure), IgA deposition is most characteristic of Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura, often following respiratory tract infections. The biopsy finding of IgA is key to making the correct diagnosis."

    "question": "A 22-year-old man presents with a 4-month history of scaly papules on the upper trunk and forehead, accompanied by mild pruritus. The lesions are greasy, hyperkeratotic, and appear to coalesce into warty plaques. Several family members have similar but milder findings. A skin biopsy reveals suprabasal clefting with dyskeratotic acantholytic cells known as 'corps ronds' and 'grains,' but no evidence of interface dermatitis or vasculitis. Direct immunofluorescence is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Seborrheic dermatitis",
      "Pemphigus vulgaris",
      "Darier disease (keratosis follicularis)",
      "Grover's disease (transient acantholytic dermatosis)",
      "Warty dyskeratoma"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Darier disease is characterized histopathologically by suprabasal acantholysis with dyskeratosis. 'Corps ronds' (rounded dyskeratotic cells with a halo) and 'grains' (flattened dyskeratotic cells with eosinophilic cytoplasm) are classic findings. The clinical scenario of persistent greasy, scaly papules in a young adult, a positive family history, and lack of immunofluorescence findings supports Darier disease. Seborrheic dermatitis lacks dyskeratosis, pemphigus vulgaris shows acantholysis but not grains or corps ronds, Grover\u2019s disease can mimic the findings but typically occurs in older men and is transient, and warty dyskeratoma is solitary and not inherited."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man is admitted to a dermatology service for widespread blistering and erosions. He is being managed with high-dose corticosteroids. One morning, a nurse mistakenly administers double the intended dose because a newly implemented electronic medication record system automatically populated yesterday's dose, and the error was not caught despite two verification steps. The team investigates how this error occurred. Which of the following BEST describes a 'latent error' in the context of this scenario?",
    "choices": [
      "The nurse misreading the dose on the electronic system before administering medication.",
      "The patient's unpredictable response to high-dose steroids resulting in confusion.",
      "The design flaw in the electronic medication system that auto-fills previous doses without alerting for dose changes, making human error more likely.",
      "The patient developing a new blister unrelated to steroids, identified during morning rounds.",
      "A transcription error during discharge summary writing about a past hospital stay."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Latent errors are organizational or design failures (such as poorly thought-out computer interfaces) that create conditions ripe for active errors (like nurse overdose) to reach the patient. In this scenario, the auto-filled dose without sufficient alerts in the computer system is a latent error that enables human mistakes to become harmful. Active errors are usually individual actions, while latent errors are hidden system-level vulnerabilities."

On examination, you note conjunctival pigmentation, pectus carinatum, and a grade 2/6 systolic murmur. His height and weight are both below the 5th percentile for age. Family history is notable for sudden cardiac death in his younger brother and his mother has similar pigmented lesions. Further workup reveals left atrial enlargement and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy on echocardiogram. What is the most likely underlying genetic etiology for his clinical syndrome?",
    "choices": [
      "Mutation in PTPN11 gene",
      "Mutation in PRKAR1A gene",
      "NF1 gene mutation",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The patient\u2019s presentation of multiple lentigines (including mucosal/conjunctival), pectus carinatum, short stature, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and family history is most consistent with PLE Lentigines syndrome (formerly LEOPARD syndrome), commonly caused by mutations in the PTPN11 gene. Carney complex (typically PRKAR1A gene) could also present with lentigines and cardiac findings (notably atrial myxoma), but the profile and genetic association fit PLE Lentigines in this scenario. NF1 is more associated with caf\u00e9 au lait macules and neurofibromas. GNAS1 is associated with Albright syndrome, and KIT mutations are related to piebaldism."

A biopsy demonstrates nests of atypical melanocytes invading the dermis with evidence of clusters of similar cells located 0.1 mm away from the primary tumor, separated by normal dermis. There is also perineural invasion and a brisk infiltrate of lymphocytes within the tumor. Which histopathologic finding most significantly upstages the melanoma according to the newest AJCC Cancer Staging Manual (8th edition)?",
    "choices": [
      "Mitotic rate greater than 1/mm\u00b2",
      "Presence of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (brisk)",
      "Perineural (neurotropic) invasion",
      "Microsatellitosis",
      "Lymphovascular invasion"

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "According to the AJCC 8th edition, the presence of microsatellitosis\u2014discontinuous nests of atypical melanocytes at least 0.05 mm away from the primary tumor with intervening normal tissue\u2014significantly upstages melanoma. Mitotic rate is no longer included in staging, and while neurotropism, lymphovascular invasion, and brisk tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes are prognostically relevant, only microsatellitosis has a direct impact on the AJCC classification."

His skin is markedly loose and sagging, especially on his neck, trunk, and limbs. On examination, you note deep nasolabial folds, pendulous skin, and a deep hoarse voice. Further review reveals a past medical history of early-onset emphysema, multiple joint dislocations, and a recent episode of spontaneous colonic diverticulum rupture. Which of the following genetic defects is most likely responsible for his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Fibrillin 1 gene mutation (AD)",
      "Lysyl oxidase deficiency (XLR)",
      "Fibronectin deficiency (AR)",
      "Fibulin 4 gene mutation (AR)",
      "Collagen type V mutation (AD)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This vignette describes cutis laxa, notable for loose, inelastic skin, deep voice, emphysema, arterial rupture, visceral diverticula, and joint dislocation. The most consistent genetic defect, particularly in the autosomal recessive (systemic) form with severe visceral involvement, is mutation in the fibulin 4 gene. Fibrillin mutations cause Marfan syndrome or congenital contractural arachnodactyly. Lysyl oxidase deficiency defines occipital horn syndrome (a mild form of EDS), and collagen type V mutations cause classic Ehlers-Danlos syndrome. Fibronectin deficiency (Type 10 EDS) presents with ecchymoses and petechiae rather than the profound skin laxity seen here."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman with a history of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) presents with a new onset of malar rash, photosensitivity, and several erosive oral ulcers. She reports recently undergoing narrowband UVB phototherapy for refractory pruritus. During her therapy, she began to notice increased fatigue and joint pain. Laboratory investigations show rising anti-dsDNA titers and decreased complement levels. Based on the reference material, what is the most likely explanation for her clinical deterioration?",
    "choices": [
      "Direct UV-induced depletion of Langerhans cells leading to immunosuppression and secondary bacterial infection.",
      "UV phototherapy-induced release of proinflammatory mediators worsening autoimmune inflammation.",
      "Development of drug-induced lupus secondary to medications for phototherapy-related side effects.",
      "Her increased exposure to sunlight leading to vitamin D deficiency and exacerbation of SLE.",
      "Reactivation of herpes simplex virus resulting in a systemic inflammatory response."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "UV phototherapy can induce the release of proinflammatory mediators by skin cells (e.g., IL-1, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1), which may exacerbate underlying autoimmune conditions like lupus. The patient\u2019s deterioration is likely due to UV-induced proinflammatory/immunostimulating effects, not secondary infection, medication, vitamin D deficiency, or viral reactivation."

She reports trying several over-the-counter shampoos with minimal improvement. She wears tight braids and weaves, and is concerned about patches of hair loss where the scalp looks shiny. On examination, there are patches of non-scarring alopecia with perifollicular scaling, but also areas with shiny smooth skin and loss of follicular openings. The rest of her skin exam is normal. She feels dismissed by previous clinicians, who did not examine her scalp or ask about her hair care practices. Which of the following best exemplifies an optimal, culturally competent approach to her diagnosis and management?",
    "choices": [
      "Suggest corticosteroid shampoo and schedule routine follow-up without further discussion.",
      "Recommend immediate scalp biopsy without discussing haircare practices or styling.",
      "Take a detailed history including her hair care and styling practices, address specific concerns about hair loss in skin of color, perform a targeted scalp exam, and discuss treatment options that respect her hair practices.",
      "Start oral antifungal therapy empirically and reassure her that this is a common problem in her ethnic group.",
      "Discuss only medical treatments available, avoiding hair care discussions to remain strictly clinical."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The best answer is to take a detailed history, including hair care and styling practices, and provide culturally competent care. This approach not only improves rapport but also leads to a more accurate and patient-centered diagnosis and treatment plan\u2014especially critical in patients with skin of color, where different hair practices and presentations are common.

    "question": "A 59-year-old man presents to the dermatologist with a 3-month history of rapidly developing dark, velvety plaques on his neck, axillae, and, more recently, on the dorsal surfaces of his hands and lips. He reports recent onset of thickened, velvety skin on his palms, described as having a rugose or 'tripe-like' texture. He has also noticed papillomatous lesions in his oral mucosa. He denies a history of diabetes or obesity but has had unintentional weight loss and early satiety. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate topical retinoids for skin thickening",
      "Order a fasting insulin and glucose to evaluate for insulin resistance",
      "Refer for gastrointestinal malignancy evaluation, particularly gastric cancer",
      "Prescribe oral terbinafine for possible fungal infection",

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The rapid onset of acanthosis nigricans involving atypical sites (dorsal hands, lips), along with tripe palms and florid oral papillomatosis, is characteristic of malignant acanthosis nigricans. This is most commonly associated with underlying malignancy, particularly gastric cancer. The presence of systemic symptoms such as weight loss and early satiety further raises suspicion for internal malignancy. The most appropriate next step is prompt evaluation for an underlying cancer, with a focus on gastrointestinal work-up."

On examination, there are firm, waxy papules arranged in linear patterns on the glabella, forehead, and postauricular neckline, along with marked skin tightening over his hands. He also reports new onset dysphagia and joint stiffness. Laboratory studies reveal the presence of an IgG lambda monoclonal paraprotein, and a skin biopsy shows increased dermal collagen, mucin deposition, and fibroblast proliferation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

She has no other significant medical history. Direct immunofluorescence of perilesional skin reveals linear deposition of C3 and IgG along the basement membrane zone. Circulating antibodies predominantly target the NC16A domain of BPAg2. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Bullous pemphigoid",
      "Pemphigus vulgaris",
      "Linear IgA disease",
      "Pemphigoid gestationis",
      "Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita"

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The correct answer is pemphigoid gestationis. This disease presents classically in pregnant women, often in the third trimester, with pruritic lesions that can form vesicles and bullae. Direct immunofluorescence shows linear C3 (and often IgG) at the basement membrane. The main autoantigen is BPAg2-NC16A, distinguishing it from other bullous diseases. Bullous pemphigoid also targets BPAg2, but the unique association with pregnancy and the NC16A domain points toward pemphigoid gestationis. Linear IgA disease targets a different part of BPAg2; pemphigus vulgaris has desmoglein antibodies; and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita involves collagen VII."

    "question": "A 75-year-old man with a history of chronic sun exposure presents with a rapidly enlarging, ulcerated nodule on his left temple. The lesion is 2.1 cm in diameter, with irregular borders and surrounding induration. The dermatologist suspects a high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) and is concerned about possible perineural invasion. Which of the following is the most appropriate biopsy technique to establish the diagnosis and guide further management in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Superficial shave biopsy limited to the epidermis",
      "Saucerization biopsy removing the superficial portion of the lesion",
      "Punch biopsy extending into the deep dermis and subcutaneous tissue",
      "Incisional biopsy limited to the periphery of the lesion",
      "Excisional biopsy with 1-2 mm margins around the visible nodule"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "For suspicious cutaneous SCCs, especially when invasive disease or perineural invasion is suspected, a punch biopsy of adequate depth is recommended to evaluate the pattern of invasion and detect perineural involvement. Superficial shave or saucerization biopsies may miss deep invasion or perineural spread. While excisional biopsy could also be diagnostic, in cosmetically sensitive areas or with large lesions, a deep punch biopsy is preferred for diagnosis before definitive treatment planning. Incisional biopsies at the periphery may not capture the most diagnostically useful area."

Previous flares of atopic dermatitis had improved without treatment by age 6, and there were no symptoms until this current eruption. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding this patient's condition and its management?",
    "choices": [
      "This patient likely has irritant contact dermatitis; strict avoidance of water exposure is curative.",
      "The patient is experiencing nummular dermatitis, for which approaches are the same as atopic dermatitis and spontaneous remissions can occur in adolescence.",
      "He should be started on tralokinumab, which targets both IL-13 and IL-4, and is the most effective agent for this presentation.",
      "His condition is associated only with allergic triggers, so patch testing should be repeated often.",
      "Nummular dermatitis in adolescence always predicts severe atopic dermatitis in adulthood."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This boy has nummular dermatitis, identified by coin-shaped, eczematous plaques, often seen on the lower extremities and closely linked to a history of atopy. Management mirrors that of atopic dermatitis (moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, etc.), and spontaneous resolution can occur, especially with a history of milder disease in childhood. There is no absolute requirement for immunosuppressive therapies like tralokinumab (which targets only IL-13 and is not the most effective agent\u2014dupilumab is superior), and the condition is neither solely caused by irritants nor exclusively by allergens. Nummular dermatitis at this age also does not necessitate a severe course into adulthood."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man with a history of severe, widespread, recalcitrant plaque psoriasis presents to the dermatology clinic. He previously failed multiple topical therapies and narrowband UVB phototherapy. He was started on a new biologic agent three months ago, with dramatic improvement in his skin lesions. At follow-up, he reports no significant adverse effects. Laboratory monitoring shows no abnormalities. Which of the following best describes the mechanism of action of the biologic agent most likely responsible for this clinical improvement?",
    "choices": [
      "Inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1)",

    "explanation": "Risankizumab is a human monoclonal antibody approved for moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. It specifically inhibits the p19 subunit of interleukin-23 (IL-23), which is distinct from earlier biologics targeting the p40 subunit shared with IL-12. Blocking IL-23 p19 is highly effective in treating psoriasis with a favorable safety profile. TNF-alpha inhibitors, IL-12/23 p40 inhibitors, and IL-17 inhibitors are also used for psoriasis but have different mechanisms. IL-36 receptor antagonists, such as spesolimab, are used for generalized pustular psoriasis rather than plaque psoriasis."

On examination, there are multiple small, yellowish papules distributed symmetrically on the vermillion border of her lips and on her buccal mucosa. Histological examination of a papule reveals prominent sebaceous lobules within the submucosa without associated hair follicles. She is otherwise healthy, and laboratory studies are unremarkable. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of her findings?",
    "choices": [

Although KA may regress spontaneously, it cannot be reliably distinguished from squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) both clinically and histologically; therefore, excision with narrow margins is recommended to allow for complete histopathological assessment. Mohs surgery is reserved for lesions in high-risk locations or recurrent cases. Topical therapies and photodynamic therapy are not standard for KA due to its potential for invasive growth. Monitoring alone is not recommended owing to diagnostic uncertainty."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with persistent, scaly plaques on his elbows and knees. A skin biopsy shows acanthosis with parakeratosis, and infiltrates of lymphocytes and neutrophils in the epidermis. Immunohistochemical staining reveals the presence of abundant CD4+ T cells. Further studies show these T cells require binding of their T cell receptor to an MHC molecule on antigen-presenting cells, as well as an interaction between CD28 and B7 for full activation. Which of the following interventions is most likely to inhibit T cell activation in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Blocking the T cell receptor with monoclonal antibodies",
      "Inhibiting CD28-B7 interaction by administering CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein",
      "Neutralizing cytokines secreted by activated T cells",
      "Stimulating class switch recombination in B cells",
      "Increasing complement activation via C3a agonists"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "T cell activation requires two signals: T cell receptor binding to MHC (signal 1) and CD28 binding to B7 on the antigen-presenting cell (signal 2). CTLA-4 is a checkpoint inhibitor that also binds B7, and its engagement leads to inhibition of T cell activation. A CTLA-4-Ig fusion protein (such as abatacept) binds to B7 and prevents CD28 co-stimulation, thereby inhibiting T cell activation. This is the most direct mechanism among the choices presented. Blocking cytokines or stimulating B cells/complement would not primarily prevent T cell activation."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes presents with a rapidly progressing necrotic ulcer on the dorsum of his hand. He had noted swelling and erythema for two days before the area turned black and developed a central eschar. Review of systems is notable for fevers and malaise. On histopathology, there is extensive dermal necrosis with angioinvasion by broad, pauciseptate hyphae and significant vessel occlusion. Which of the following histologic features would most likely be seen in this case?",
    "choices": [
      "Basket-weave orthokeratosis with sparse inflammation",
      "Eccrine gland necrosis with subepidermal blistering",
      "Red ball-like dermal proliferation of smooth muscle and vessels",
      "Copper-colored sclerotic bodies ('copper pennies') within granulomas",
      "Broad, ribbon-like hyphae with angioinvasion in the dermis"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histopathologic scenario describes a case of angioinvasive fungal infection, most likely Mucormycosis, in an immunocompromised (diabetic) patient. This is characterized histologically by broad, ribbon-like, pauciseptate hyphae invading dermal blood vessels (choice E). Basket-weave orthokeratosis (A) is seen in TEN, eccrine gland necrosis (B) is seen in coma bullae, red ball-like smooth muscle proliferation (C) refers to angioleiomyomas, and copper-colored bodies (D) indicate chromoblastomycosis."

    "question": "A 72-year-old man presents with a rapidly growing, non-tender, violaceous nodule on the sun-exposed skin of the left forearm. The lesion was excised and histopathology confirmed Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), localized with clear surgical margins. The patient has chronic kidney disease and severe congestive heart failure, making him a poor candidate for further surgery. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Observation only, given complete excision and comorbidities",
      "Initiate adjuvant radiation therapy to the surgical site",
      "Start platinum-based chemotherapy immediately",
      "Begin systemic checkpoint inhibitor therapy with avelumab",
      "Proceed with local heat-based ablation therapy"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "For patients with localized MCC, adjuvant radiation therapy is recommended after complete excision\u2014especially in poor surgical candidates or those at higher risk of recurrence. Radiation may improve overall survival and local control. Chemotherapy and immune checkpoint inhibitors like avelumab are reserved for systemic disease. Observation alone is suboptimal, and local ablation is not standard for MCC."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with a full-thickness laceration on his forearm after a bicycle accident. Over the next several days, the wound undergoes reepithelialization. Which stem cell population plays the primary role in restoring the epidermal barrier during this process?",
    "choices": [
      "Sebaceous gland stem cells",
      "Merkel cell stem cells",

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "While both hair follicle stem cells and interfollicular keratinocyte stem cells can contribute to epidermal repair following a full-thickness skin wound, interfollicular keratinocyte stem cells play the main role in reepithelialization of the wound site. HFSCs have only a minor role in this process, as most of the restoration of epidermal integrity is achieved by the keratinocyte stem cells residing in the interfollicular epidermis."

    "question": "A 68-year-old woman with a longstanding history of venous insufficiency and chronic leg ulcers presents with worsening pruritus and eczematous plaques surrounding her ulcers. She has been applying various over-the-counter ointments, prescription creams, and emollients without improvement. Patch testing reveals a strong delayed hypersensitivity reaction to lanolin. Which of the following is the most clinically relevant explanation for her persistent dermatitis?",
    "choices": [
      "She is reacting to excipients in topical antibiotics, with cross-reactivity to bacitracin.",
      "She has developed contact sensitivity to a preservative often found in cosmetics and biocides, such as methylchloroisothiazolinone.",

      "She is experiencing a delayed hypersensitivity reaction to neomycin, commonly found in topical antibiotic creams.",
      "She is reacting to formaldehyde-releasing preservatives in her moisturizers."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Lanolin is commonly used in creams, ointments, and emollients applied to chronic ulcers, especially among elderly patients with leg ulcers. This patient\u2019s history and positive patch test strongly indicate allergic contact dermatitis to lanolin, which is especially prevalent in this population. Cross-reactivity and variable tolerance between formulations can occur, and exposure often results from wound-care routines that include lanolin-containing products."

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman undergoes a facelift procedure. Postoperatively, she notices numbness of the lower two-thirds of her ear, as well as an area extending onto the adjacent cheek and lateral neck. Motor function remains intact, and there is no facial muscle weakness. Which nerve was most likely injured during the procedure?",
    "choices": [
      "Greater auricular nerve",
      "Auriculotemporal nerve",
      "Marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve",
      "Lesser occipital nerve",
      "Great auricular nerve anterior branch"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The area of numbness described (inferior two-thirds of the ear, adjacent cheek, and neck) corresponds to the sensory territory supplied by the greater auricular nerve, which runs posterior to the SMAS (Superficial Musculoaponeurotic System). Injury to this nerve is a well-known risk during facelift surgery. The auriculotemporal nerve supplies the anterior auricle and temporal scalp; the marginal mandibular branch is motor; the lesser occipital nerve supplies the posterior auricular area. The correct choice is the greater auricular nerve."

Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Onchocerciasis (Onchocerca volvulus)",

    "explanation": "The scenario describes granulomatous inflammation with a worm that has a thick muscular wall\u2014a classic histologic finding in dirofilariasis, most commonly caused by Dirofilaria tenuis. Onchocerciasis is characterized by thin microfilariae without a thick worm wall. Schistosomiasis would show ova with stippling. Sparganosis is caused by flatworms, which have characteristic calcareous bodies. Myiasis involves larval forms with a corrugated chitinous wall and visible gross pigmented spikes, not a thick muscular worm wall."

The lesions have developed thick black eschars. He began oral isotretinoin two weeks prior for severe acne, and now complains of fever, joint pain, and malaise. Blood tests show leukocytosis. Radiographs reveal lytic lesions in the sternoclavicular area, but cultures from the ulcer bases are sterile. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Acne conglobata",
      "Hidradenitis suppurativa",
      "Acne fulminans",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum",
      "Dissecting cellulitis of the scalp"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes the classic presentation of acne fulminans: a sudden, severe, ulcerative acne eruption in young males, often with systemic symptoms (fever, arthralgia, leukocytosis), development of black eschars, and lytic bone lesions (especially in the sternoclavicular region). It can be triggered by isotretinoin, especially at high doses, as seen here. Acne conglobata and hidradenitis suppurativa are chronic, less explosive disorders. Pyoderma gangrenosum shows sterile ulcers but not in the same context, and dissecting cellulitis affects the scalp."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman presents with diffuse hair thinning over the crown and temples for 8 months. On examination, there is noticeable miniaturization of hair shafts without scarring or erythema. A scalp biopsy is taken and on histopathology, horizontal sections at the level of the isthmus show decreased terminal: vellus hair ratio, presence of fibrous streamers (stelae) beneath the follicles, and sebaceous glands are identified near the hair follicles. Which of the following additional histologic findings most supports a diagnosis of telogen effluvium rather than androgenetic alopecia?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased percentage of hairs in catagen/telogen phase without follicular miniaturization",
      "Clusters of perifollicular lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrous tract formation",
      "Markedly reduced number of sebaceous glands at the isthmus",
      "Random follicular dropout with significant perifollicular fibrosis",
      "Prominent eosinophilic centers with dyskeratosis in lower follicular portions"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Telogen effluvium is characterized on histology by an increased proportion of hair follicles in the catagen or telogen phase at the level of the isthmus, but without the follicular miniaturization, fibrous streamers, or severe perifollicular fibrosis seen in androgenetic alopecia or cicatricial alopecias. The presence of miniaturized follicles, fibrous streamers, and sebaceous glands suggests a non-scarring process, but the key distinguishing feature for telogen effluvium is the shift toward telogen/catagen hairs without miniaturization (Choice 0). Androgenetic alopecia shows miniaturization; lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis point to scarring/cicatricial alopecias; loss of sebaceous glands and perifollicular fibrosis are also signs of scarring alopecia. Eosinophilic centers with dyskeratosis are not typical in telogen effluvium."

    "question": "A 35-year-old Black woman presents to the dermatology clinic with a 6-month history of recurrent, pruritic, hyperpigmented papules on her lower legs. She reports worsening after using a new topical steroid prescribed by her primary care provider for presumed eczema. Past treatments have provided minimal improvement. She is otherwise healthy, but mentions she styles her hair with protective braids and uses oils on her scalp. On examination, there are multiple coalescent, violaceous papules and plaques with excoriation and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation on her shins, but no scale or lichenification. Which of the following quality improvement outcome measures would most appropriately assess the dermatology clinic's impact in addressing skin of color health disparities in this scenario?",
    "choices": [
      "A) Percentage of patients with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation prescribed hydroquinone cream",
      "B) Number of new Black patients scheduled for annual melanoma skin checks",
      "C) Percentage of patients with skin of color reporting satisfaction with their care in the clinic",
      "D) Number of educational sessions provided to residents on hair care in skin of color",
      "E) Percentage of patients who received patch testing for contact dermatitis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The most appropriate outcome measure assesses the impact of clinical care on patients, especially with respect to health disparities for skin of color. Option C, the percentage of patients with skin of color reporting satisfaction with their care, directly assesses the clinic's impact from the patient perspective, which is an outcome measure. Choices A, D, and E are process measures (they measure actions taken). Option B is also a process measure since it tracks scheduling, not impact. Thus, C best reflects an outcome measure relevant to patient-centered care and equity in skin of color dermatology."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents with a slowly enlarging, soft, fluctuant nodule on the medial aspect of her right thigh. She first noticed it several months ago. The lesion is asymptomatic and has not changed in color or become inflamed. On examination, there is a 2-cm subcutaneous nodule that is non-tender and not attached to underlying structures. Excisional biopsy reveals a cyst lined by cuboidal epithelial cells with prominent cilia; the cyst lumen is filled with cellular debris, and there is no evidence of sebaceous differentiation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Median raphe cyst",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "A cutaneous ciliated cyst typically arises on the lower extremities of women and is characterized histologically by a lining of cuboidal or columnar ciliated epithelial cells with cystic debris. Median raphe cysts are typically midline, along the anogenital raphe, and have pseudostratified columnar epithelium which may rarely be ciliated, but they are not found on the lower extremities. Epidermoid cysts and steatocystoma multiplex have different epithelial linings, and digital mucous cysts are found at the base of the nail rather than on the thigh."

The lesions have developed over a few months; some have resolved leaving depressed, atrophic areas. She denies pruritus. On examination, the nodules are sharply demarcated, rubbery-firm, and there are overlying discoid plaques on a few lesions. A biopsy shows lobular panniculitis with lymphoid follicles in the septae and hyaline degeneration of fat. What is the most appropriate first-line treatment for her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Topical high-potency corticosteroids",
      "Systemic methotrexate",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes lupus erythematosus panniculitis (lupus profundus), characterized by non-tender, deep nodules, fat atrophy, and overlying discoid plaques in about 50% of cases. Histology confirming lobular panniculitis with lymphoid follicles and hyaline fat degeneration is classic. First-line therapy is oral antimalarials (e.g., hydroxychloroquine), often for several months. Topical corticosteroids and methotrexate are not first-line agents; antibiotics and surgery are not indicated."

Examination reveals a 2.5-cm erythematous plaque with slight central depression and an irregular border, with minimal scale. There is no lymphadenopathy. A punch biopsy is performed, revealing atypical keratinocytes throughout the thickness of the epidermis, without invasion into the dermis. Which of the following best explains the origin of the neoplastic cells in this lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Proliferation of basal layer keratinocytes derived from interfollicular stem cells",
      "Expansion of Langerhans cells from the suprabasal epidermis",
      "Clonal expansion of keratinocyte stem cells of the hair follicle bulge",
      "Proliferation and upward migration of spinous layer (suprabasal) keratinocytes",
      "Expansion of resident melanocyte stem cells within the hair bulb"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The lesion described clinically and histologically is most consistent with Bowen's disease (squamous cell carcinoma in situ). Growing evidence suggests that cutaneous epithelial neoplasms, particularly SCC in situ, can arise from keratinocyte stem cells located in the bulge region of the hair follicle. These allow for clonal expansion and propagation of atypical keratinocytes throughout the epidermis. While basal and suprabasal keratinocytes do undergo proliferation, stem cells within the follicular bulge are thought to serve as a reservoir from which neoplastic transformation can originate, according to recent lineage tracing and stem cell research (see references 5 and 6)."

On examination, there is extensive cellulitis with hemorrhagic bullae and early signs of necrosis. Laboratory studies reveal leukocytosis and evidence of sepsis. Which of the following organisms is most likely responsible for his clinical presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Pasteurella multocida",
      "Eikenella corrodens",
      "Capnocytophaga canimorsus",

It can cause severe sepsis, purpura fulminans, and rapid progression to necrosis in immunocompromised or asplenic patients, and is associated with high mortality. Pasteurella multocida is common in cat bites and associated with soft tissue infections; Eikenella corrodens is more common in human bites; Aeromonas hydrophila is associated with leech bites; and Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of skin infections but does not specifically cause this syndrome in the setting of a dog bite."

The lesion is well-circumscribed, measures about 1.5 cm, and demonstrates a faint brown color with a slightly polypoid appearance. There is no ulceration or deep infiltration. Histologically, the lesion shows dense, deep proliferation of spindle cells, occasional mitotic figures, and scattered large pleomorphic ('monster') cells. Spindle and monster cells are negative for CD34 but stain positively for factor XIIIa and stromelysin-3. There is no evidence of fat infiltration or adnexal destruction. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cellular dermatofibroma, monster cell variant",
      "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans",
      "Epithelioid cell histiocytoma",
      "Atypical fibroxanthoma",

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The described lesion fits with a cellular dermatofibroma, particularly the monster cell variant, which is characterized by deep, dense proliferation, mitotic activity, and scattered large pleomorphic 'monster' cells. Immunohistochemistry is crucial: factor XIIIa and stromelysin-3 positivity with CD34 negativity supports dermatofibroma over dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP), which would be CD34-positive. Epithelioid cell histiocytoma presents differently (epithelioid morphology, ALK positivity), while atypical fibroxanthoma and desmoplastic melanoma typically occur in sun-exposed areas of older individuals and would show different staining profiles."

    "explanation": "This boy presents with classic findings of nail-patella syndrome: hypoplastic or absent nails, triangular or absent lunulae, absent patellae, small joint hyperextensibility, and possible ocular and renal anomalies. The syndrome is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in the LMX1B gene (Choice 2). KRT6A and KRT17 mutations are seen in pachyonychia congenita types I and II, respectively. COL7A1 mutations cause dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, and P63 mutations are associated with ectodermal dysplasia syndromes."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The presence of regular acanthosis at low power could suggest psoriasis, chronic spongiotic dermatitis, or dermatophytosis. However, the identification of hyphae in the stratum corneum on PAS stain is characteristic of dermatophytosis, making it the correct answer. Psoriasis would have neutrophils in the stratum corneum, chronic spongiotic dermatitis would lack fungal elements, SCCIS would show atypical keratinocytes, and lichen sclerosus has distinctive histopathologic features not present here."

    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes an infant with chronic, difficult-to-treat ulcerative lesions in the diaper area, most severe at the perianal region and sparing the folds. The presence of punched-out ulcers with rolled, elevated borders are classic for Jacquet\u2019s diaper dermatitis, a severe form of irritant diaper dermatitis distinguished by ulcerations and chronicity. Bullous impetigo tends to present with flaccid bullae and honey-colored crusts rather than punched-out ulcers. Perianal pseudoverrucous papules and nodules are associated with chronic irritant exposure (e.g., in children with incontinence), presenting as smooth, dome-shaped papules without the ulcerative, punched-out nature. Candidal diaper dermatitis typically involves satellite pustules and includes the inguinal folds. Congenital syphilis would have systemic findings and more generalized cutaneous involvement, not isolated to the diaper region with the described features."

There is also noted clitoromegaly and mild intellectual delay. Laboratory workup reveals marked insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, and elevated serum triglycerides; liver ultrasound shows hepatomegaly, and early cirrhotic changes are suspected. What is the most likely underlying molecular abnormality in this patient?",

The most common genetic cause is a mutation in the BSCL2 gene, which encodes the protein seipin involved in adipocyte development; some references mention a role for nuclear lamins.

The clinical scenario, together with the family history (autosomal dominant inheritance) and involvement of a transmembrane cadherin defect in the desmosome, points towards Desmoglein I mutation. Desmoglein I is a desmosomal cadherin whose mutation causes this pattern of keratoderma and skin fragility. Desmoglein III is associated with pemphigus vulgaris, plakophilin with ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syndrome, envoplakin with paraneoplastic pemphigus, and Band 6 protein with ectodermal dysplasia/skin fragility syndrome."

      "CO2 laser (10,600 nm) to the axillae",
      "Pulsed dye laser (585 nm) to the axillae",
      "Nd:YAG laser (1,064 nm) to the axillae",
      "Monopolar radiofrequency applied to the axillae",
      "Excimer laser (308 nm) to the axillae"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Monopolar radiofrequency devices use longer non-laser wavelengths (outside the typical laser spectrum) that can penetrate the deep dermis and target sweat glands for skin tightening and sweat reduction, while not presenting a risk of retinal or other ocular injuries associated with UV, visible, or infrared lasers. Lasers that emit within the 308\u201310,600 nm range can injure the cornea, lens, or retina depending on their wavelength (as per the provided table), while radiofrequency and other non-laser energy modalities avoid these specific ocular risks."

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents with a 3-week history of recurrent, burning, painful wheals involving her trunk and proximal extremities. Each individual lesion lasts about 2-3 days, often resolving with post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. She reports fever, episodic joint pain, and occasional headaches. Physical exam reveals edematous, erythematous plaques without angioedema. Laboratory evaluation is notable for mild proteinuria and a low C3 level. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Chronic idiopathic urticaria",
      "Serum sickness-like reaction to medication",
      "Normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis",
      "Hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis",
      "Dermatitis herpetiformis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The patient's symptoms suggest urticarial vasculitis (chronic, burning, painful lesions >24 hours, systemic symptoms such as arthralgia, headache, mild renal findings, and hypocomplementemia). Normocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis typically has milder disease and preserved complement levels, while hypocomplementemic urticarial vasculitis tends to have multisystem involvement and low complement levels (as in this case). Chronic idiopathic urticaria features itchy, transient lesions without systemic manifestations; serum sickness-like reaction often has urticarial lesions but is temporally related to new medications; dermatitis herpetiformis is characterized by grouped vesicles, not plaques."

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy is brought to dermatology clinic for evaluation of a new mole on his right cheek. His parents report rapid growth over the past month. On examination, there is a 7-mm smooth, dome-shaped, pink-tan papule without ulceration or crusting. Dermoscopic examination reveals a symmetric starburst pattern of peripheral streaks. The patient has no family history of melanoma but his mother is concerned because her uncle died of melanoma at a young age. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Amelanotic melanoma",
      "Halo nevus",
      "Pigmented Spitz nevus",
      "Congenital melanocytic nevus",
      "Dermatofibroma"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Pigmented Spitz nevus is a benign melanocytic lesion that often presents as a rapidly growing, dome-shaped, pink or tan papule in children or adolescents. The starburst pattern on dermoscopy (radial streaks at the periphery) is characteristic for pigmented Spitz nevus (especially the pigmented spindle cell nevus of Reed). Melanoma is rare in this age group, and the symmetric appearance with the described clinical and dermoscopic features favors Spitz nevus. Halo nevus would show a rim of depigmentation. Congenital nevi are present since birth, and dermatofibromas are typically firm, brown papules with a central dimple on lateral compression."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man undergoes surgical excision and layered closure of a basal cell carcinoma on the left ear. On postoperative day 5, the patient returns with increasing pain, redness, swelling, and purulent drainage from the wound, accompanied by mild fever. Examination reveals wound edge separation with surrounding erythema and fluctuance. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in his management?",
    "choices": [
      "Remove all sutures, perform wound culture and irrigation, allow healing by second intention, and initiate empiric antibiotics targeting MRSA.",
      "Leave the sutures in place, prescribe topical mupirocin, and schedule routine follow-up.",
      "Apply warm compresses only and reassess in 48 hours.",
      "Remove only superficial sutures, start oral cephalexin, and reclose the wound after one week.",
      "Refer immediately for surgical debridement under general anesthesia without culturing the wound."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The described scenario suggests a surgical site infection with dehiscence, likely with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) as shown by the purulent drainage and rapid postoperative course. Sutures should be removed as they can serve as a nidus for infection. The wound must be irrigated, cultured, and allowed to heal by secondary intention. Empiric antibiotics covering MRSA should be started, especially in high-risk areas such as the ear. Other options fail to adequately address infection control, wound care, and source eradication."

    "question": "A 33-year-old man presents with a non-healing ulcer on his lower leg following a traumatic abrasion sustained 6 weeks earlier. On examination, there is an ulcer with irregular margins, minimal exudate, and surrounding hyperpigmentation. Biopsy reveals marked acanthosis, a thickened basement membrane, and proliferating basal keratinocytes which strongly express \u03b16\u03b24-integrin and evidence of cohesive attachment to an underlying laminin-5\u2013rich matrix. Which of the following signaling mechanisms is MOST directly responsible for promoting the proliferation of these basal cells during re-epithelialization?",
    "choices": [
      "Interleukin-1 (IL-1) signaling by epidermal Langerhans cells",
      "Notch pathway activation by suprabasal keratinocytes",
      "Secretion of FGF-7 and FGF-10 by dermal fibroblasts",
      "Wnt signaling from hair follicle bulge cells",
      "Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) release from endothelial cells"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In epidermal wound healing, basal keratinocyte stem cells reside in the interfollicular epidermis and adhere to the basement membrane via integrins, especially \u03b16\u03b24. Dermal fibroblasts support the proliferation of these basal keratinocytes primarily through secreting growth factors such as FGF-7 and FGF-10, along with IGF and EGF ligands. Notch signaling is critical for the subsequent transition to the spinous layer, but proliferation within the basal layer is most directly promoted by the fibroblast-derived factors, making option 3 correct."

    "question": "A 29-year-old woman presents with diffuse hair thinning over the crown. A scalp biopsy is performed, and horizontal sections are examined at the level of the isthmus. Which of the following findings would most strongly support a diagnosis of androgenetic alopecia rather than chronic telogen effluvium?",
    "choices": [
      "Increased number of terminal anagen follicles with bulbs above the adipose tissue",
      "Hair shafts with diameter smaller than that of the inner root sheath",
      "Abundant fibrous streamers (stelae) beneath the miniaturized follicles",
      "Hair follicles with brightly eosinophilic centers and evidence of dyskeratosis",
      "A predominance of telogen follicles with stellate basophilic centers"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by miniaturization of hair follicles, which on horizontal section appears as increased vellus or miniaturized hairs (hair shaft diameter smaller than that of the inner root sheath), and fibrous streamers (stelae) are often seen beneath these miniaturized or dropped-out follicles. In contrast, chronic telogen effluvium is associated with increased telogen follicles (stellate basophilic centers) but without significant follicular miniaturization or fibrous streamers. Catagen follicles have brightly eosinophilic centers with dyskeratosis. Terminal anagen follicles have large bulbs in the fat."

The skin is markedly indurated, shiny, and waxy without clear demarcation between affected and unaffected areas. He also complains of dysphagia and mild muscle weakness. On examination, the patient has deep vertical furrows over the glabella and thickening of the nasolabial folds, resulting in a leonine facies. Laboratory studies show a monoclonal spike in the gamma region. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Localized scleroderma (morphea)",
      "Systemic sclerosis (diffuse type)",
      "Scleredema adultorum",
      "Scleromyxedema",
      "Dermatopathic lymphadenitis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient's clinical features\u2014nonpitting symmetric skin induration with a waxy, shiny appearance; involvement of the neck, face, trunk; deep glabellar furrows and leonine facies; systemic manifestations including dysphagia; and a monoclonal gammopathy\u2014are characteristic of scleromyxedema, a rare cutaneous and systemic disease almost always associated with a paraproteinemia (usually IgG lambda). Scleredema typically spares the face and lacks paraproteinemia, while systemic sclerosis often features Raynaud's phenomenon, digital ulcers, and does not present with paraproteinemia as a key finding. Morphea and dermatopathic lymphadenitis do not fit the described systemic and cutaneous findings."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man with a past medical history of end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presents with severe pain and non-healing ulcerations over the thighs and abdomen. The lesions began as tender purplish plaques that rapidly developed into necrotic eschars with a reticulated pattern. On examination, there are indurated, violaceous plaques with central black eschar and surrounding livedo. Laboratory studies reveal elevated phosphate and parathyroid hormone levels. Which of the following is the most likely pathological process underlying this patient\u2019s cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Immune complex-mediated small vessel vasculitis",
      "Microvascular thrombosis due to antiphospholipid antibodies",
      "Dystrophic calcification due to chronic venous insufficiency",
      "Metastatic calcification secondary to disordered mineral metabolism",
      "Granulomatous inflammation with lobular panniculitis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The patient\u2019s clinical scenario is classic for calcific uremic arteriolopathy (calciphylaxis), which typically occurs in patients with end-stage renal disease. The pathogenesis involves vascular calcification leading to occlusion of microvessels in the dermis and subcutaneous tissue. This process is driven by disturbances in calcium and phosphate metabolism (not due to direct vascular injury or autoimmune processes). Elevated parathyroid hormone and the calcium-phosphate product facilitate metastatic (not dystrophic) calcification, resulting in painful, violaceous plaques and eschars characteristic of calciphylaxis."

    "question": "A 45-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with complaints of persistent, firm, tender nodules with intermittent swelling on her cheeks that began several years after she underwent soft tissue augmentation overseas. She reports the nodules slowly enlarging over time and occasional discoloration of the overlying skin. Examination reveals multiple firm, subcutaneous nodules along the prior filler injection sites, some with bluish discoloration. She has no fever or systemic symptoms. A biopsy demonstrates foreign-body granulomatous inflammation. Attempts to treat with hyaluronidase produce no change. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for these findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Delayed reaction to hyaluronic acid filler, best managed with repeat hyaluronidase",
      "Biofilm infection caused by Staphylococcus aureus at injection site",
      "Granuloma formation due to migration of non-FDA-approved silicone filler",
      "Hypersensitivity reaction to poly-L-lactic acid filler",
      "vascular occlusion with resultant necrosis due to filler embolism"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Silicone is not currently FDA approved for soft tissue augmentation. In addition to hypersensitivity reactions and product migration, granuloma formation can occur years after injection, often presenting as firm, persistent nodules. Hyaluronidase does not affect silicone, so lack of response to this suggests a non-hyaluronic acid product. Granulomas are a well-known long-term complication of silicone fillers, especially when improperly injected or from unregulated sources."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with an irregularly pigmented, slowly enlarging flat lesion on his upper back, measuring 1.3 cm in diameter. A biopsy is performed. Histopathological examination reveals large nests of melanocytes along the sides and between rete ridges, confluent melanocyte proliferation at the dermoepidermal junction with focal clefting, and pagetoid spread of atypical melanocytes throughout all levels of the epidermis. There are numerous mitotic figures and loss of maturation with sheet-like growth of cells into the dermis. Which of the following diagnoses best fits these histopathological findings?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Benign junctional nevus",

    "explanation": "The described features\u2014nests along the sides and between rete ridges, confluent growth at the DEJ with clefting, extensive pagetoid upward spread of melanocytes, numerous mitoses, and loss of maturation\u2014are characteristic of superficial spreading melanoma. Benign and dysplastic nevi have more organized distribution and maturation, and pagetoid spread is limited or absent. Seborrheic keratosis and lentigo simplex lack such cytologic atypia and pagetoid spread."

Examination reveals a 1.5 cm nodule with a subtle central depression and no overlying ulceration. A punch biopsy shows papillary (frond-like) projections into cystic spaces, prominent plasma cells in the surrounding stroma, and an epidermal connection. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

This lesion most commonly occurs on the scalp and often appears during childhood or early adulthood. Hidradenoma papilliferum, by contrast, lacks an epidermal connection and is most often found on the vulva/perineum; syringoma presents with 'tadpole' or 'paisley tie' duct-like structures and not with papillary fronds or plasma cells; microcystic adnexal carcinoma is a deeply infiltrative tumor with perineural invasion; poroma is composed of broad anastomosing bands of poroid cells."

Over time, some plaques have become thickened and hyperkeratotic. Despite topical steroids, new lesions continue to appear intermittently, and some of her hair has become sparse with scarring patches on the scalp. Which of the following clinical features best explains the likely prognosis for her scalp involvement?",
    "choices": [
      "Spontaneous remission within 18 months is likely for the scalp disease.",
      "Chronic relapsing course is typical, but hair regrowth is expected if inflammation resolves early.",
      "The scalp disease is usually chronic and progressive, with little potential for hair regrowth.",

      "Rapid involution is the rule, but oral lesions may persist indefinitely."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient's scalp feature is lichen planopilaris, a follicular variant of lichen planus, characterized by scarring alopecia. Among the types of lichen planus, lichen planopilaris is the most chronic and progressive, and has little potential for hair regrowth due to scarring. Other forms may resolve more readily, but scarring alopecia is generally permanent."

A punch biopsy reveals basaloid islands with angulated contours embedded in dense, pink, sclerotic stroma. There are scattered small horn cysts and focal calcifications. No mucinous stroma, retraction artifact, or perineural involvement is noted. Based on these findings, which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Morpheaform (infiltrative) basal cell carcinoma",
      "Trichoepithelioma",
      "Trichoblastoma",
      "Trichofolliculoma",

Morpheaform BCC would typically have mucin, retraction artifact, and possibly perineural involvement. Trichoblastoma tends to show larger aggregates and deeper invasion. Trichofolliculoma is characterized by a central dilated follicle with radiating 'daughter' follicles. Microcystic adnexal carcinoma shows both follicular and ductal differentiation and often has vertically oriented aggregates and perineural invasion."

Previous topical therapies have failed to control her symptoms, and her quality of life is significantly affected. After multidisciplinary discussion, a decision is made to commence a potent topical corticosteroid, and systemic corticosteroid therapy is considered as a short-term adjunct. Regarding the management of her corticosteroid therapy in pregnancy, which of the following statements is most accurate?",
    "choices": [
      "Systemic corticosteroids should be avoided entirely due to the high risk of teratogenicity in the third trimester.",
      "Ultrapotent topical corticosteroids can be used freely, as there are no known fetal risks with their application.",
      "Alternate-day systemic corticosteroid dosing reduces the risk of maternal and fetal complications, except for the increased risk of low birth weight.",
      "Cortisone and hydrocortisone are preferred systemic agents in pregnancy due to their low mineralocorticoid activity.",
      "Systemic corticosteroid therapy in pregnancy carries no clinical risk of osteoporosis, cataracts, or avascular necrosis with routine obstetric care."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Alternate-day systemic corticosteroid dosing is used to minimize maternal toxicity, but this regimen does not reduce the risk of low birth weight, which remains an associated concern with systemic corticosteroid use in pregnancy. Ultrapotent topical steroids should be used judiciously because use in pregnancy, particularly in high doses, has been associated with low birth weight. Systemic corticosteroids are not considered highly teratogenic but must be balanced against maternal and fetal risks. Cortisone and hydrocortisone are short-acting corticosteroids with the highest mineralocorticoid activity, not the lowest. Chronic systemic corticosteroid use can increase the risk of osteoporosis, cataracts (especially posterior subcapsular type), and avascular necrosis, even in pregnancy."

The infant is otherwise well, feeding appropriately, and gaining weight. Over the next two weeks, the lesion increases in size and begins to show superficial ulceration. The mother is concerned about potential disfigurement and scarring. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Reassure the parents, as the lesion is likely to involute without intervention.",
      "Initiate topical corticosteroids to the lesion.",
      "Begin oral propranolol after appropriate cardiac evaluation.",
      "Arrange urgent surgical excision of the lesion.",
      "Refer for laser therapy as first line."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation describes a proliferative infantile hemangioma, characterized by rapid growth within the first weeks to months of life followed by a slow involution phase. While many infantile hemangiomas are managed expectantly, complicated hemangiomas\u2014such as those that ulcerate or threaten function/cosmesis\u2014require intervention. Recent guidelines and evidence support the use of oral propranolol as first-line treatment for problematic infantile hemangiomas, provided appropriate cardiac evaluation is done beforehand, as it is effective and generally well-tolerated. Topical corticosteroids and laser therapy are less effective, and surgical excision is generally reserved for refractory cases or when there is a threat to vital structures. Reassurance alone is not appropriate in the setting of ulceration, rapid growth, and risk of significant disfigurement."

On examination, the nodule is approximately 1.3 cm in diameter, non-tender, and has a smooth, flesh-colored surface. There is no cervical lymphadenopathy. An excisional biopsy is performed. Histopathology reveals nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading, surrounded by a dense fibromyxoid stroma, and horn cysts. There is no evidence of perineural invasion. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Mohs micrographic surgery to ensure complete excision and tissue preservation",
      "Wide local excision with 1 cm margins due to deep invasion risk",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient likely has a nodular basal cell carcinoma (BCC) based on clinical and histopathological findings. Mohs micrographic surgery is the treatment of choice for BCCs on the face due to its high cure rate and maximal tissue preservation, minimizing functional and cosmetic impairment. Wide local excision with large margins is typically reserved for higher-risk or larger lesions. Observation is not appropriate as BCC is locally destructive. Radiotherapy is considered for non-surgical candidates. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is not indicated, as BCC very rarely metastasizes."

The inner root sheath is observed keratinizing above the level of the isthmus. No granular layer is visible in some areas, while in others, a granular layer with basophilic keratohyaline granules is present. Which phase of the hair cycle is best represented by the described follicle?",
    "choices": [

      "Catagen",
      "Early anagen",
      "Late anagen (terminal)",
      "Miniaturized/vellus follicle"

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The key features described are a bulb in the subcutaneous fat (which is characteristic of anagen), a large-diameter hair shaft (indicating a terminal rather than miniaturized/vellus hair), and inner root sheath keratinization above the level of the isthmus. Additionally, the presence of sections with a granular layer (infundibulum) and others without (isthmus) is consistent with the normal follicle structure in anagen. Catagen is marked by a brightly eosinophilic center with dyskeratosis, while telogen shows a stellate basophilic center. Miniaturized or vellus follicles would have a hair shaft smaller than the width of the inner root sheath. Therefore, the correct answer is late anagen (terminal phase)."

On examination, multiple ulcers are seen with irregular, violaceous edges and surrounding erythema. Laboratory tests show mild leukocytosis and elevated inflammatory markers, but no growth on wound cultures. Biopsy reveals neutrophilic infiltrate with abscess formation in the dermis, but no vasculitis or infectious organisms. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum",
      "Cutaneous tuberculosis",
      "Ecthyma gangrenosum",
      "Sweet's syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)",
      "Behcet\u2019s disease"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical description is classic for pyoderma gangrenosum: rapidly progressing, painful ulcers with undermined violaceous borders, often associated with systemic diseases like inflammatory bowel disease. Biopsy showing neutrophilic infiltrate without vasculitis or infection supports this. Cutaneous TB and ecthyma gangrenosum usually have detectable organisms. Sweet's syndrome would present as tender papules or plaques, not ulcers. Behcet's disease ulcers usually involve mucous membranes and have a different histology."

    "question": "A 64-year-old man presents with an indurated, poorly defined plaque on his upper lip that has been slowly enlarging over three years, occasionally causing numbness. Previous superficial shave biopsy was non-diagnostic. A deep incisional biopsy is now obtained. Histology shows basaloid tumor nests, keratinous cysts, and duct-like structures embedded within a dense desmoplastic stroma. The tumor infiltrates deep into subcutaneous fat and demonstrates perineural involvement. Cytologic atypia and mitotic figures are rare. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Morpheaform basal cell carcinoma",
      "Desmoplastic trichoepithelioma",
      "Syringoma",
      "Microcystic adnexal carcinoma",
      "Infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario and the histologic features\u2014including deep subcutaneous invasion, perineural involvement, basaloid nests, keratin cysts, ducts within a desmoplastic stroma, and rare cytologic atypia\u2014are classic for microcystic adnexal carcinoma (MAC). Morpheaform BCC and desmoplastic trichoepithelioma can appear similar but lack the combination of ductal differentiation, deep invasion, and frequent perineural spread seen in MAC. Syringoma is more superficial and benign, and infiltrative squamous cell carcinoma shows more atypia and mitoses."

    "question": "A 48-year-old woman presents to the dermatology clinic with firm, painless nodules on her cheeks that developed five months after she received facial injections for cosmetic enhancement abroad. Physical examination reveals multiple, palpable, mobile subcutaneous nodules without overlying erythema or warmth. She denies any fever or systemic symptoms. A biopsy of one nodule is performed. Histopathology reveals multiple calcified spheres in the dermis surrounded by granulomatous inflammation. The lesion is radiopaque on facial X-ray imaging. Which filler is the most likely cause of her presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Calcium hydroxylapatite filler",
      "Hyaluronic acid filler",
      "Silicone",
      "Poly-L-lactic acid",
      "Paraffinoma"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The biopsy findings of calcified dermal spheres with granulomatous inflammation and radiopacity on imaging are characteristic of calcium hydroxylapatite filler. Hyaluronic acid fillers do not create radiopaque lesions or calcified spheres on histology. Silicone and paraffinoma produce cystic spaces or vacuoles, and distinguishing between them relies heavily on clinical history and subtle histological differences, but neither is described as radiopaque with calcified spheres. Poly-L-lactic acid is not characterized by these findings."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man with poorly controlled type II diabetes presents with a sudden eruption of multiple small, yellowish papules with erythematous halos on his buttocks, thighs, and elbows. He reports that the lesions are mildly pruritic. Laboratory tests reveal markedly elevated triglyceride levels and moderate hyperglycemia. He denies any joint pain. Which of the following lipid disorders is most consistent with this patient\u2019s dermatologic findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Tendinous xanthomas from familial hypercholesterolemia",

      "Planar xanthomas from familial dysbetalipoproteinemia",
      "Xanthelasma from secondary hypercholesterolemia"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Eruptive xanthomas present as sudden crops of small, yellow papules with erythematous bases, usually on the buttocks, thighs, or extensor surfaces. They are most often associated with severe hypertriglyceridemia (types I, IV, or V hyperlipoproteinemia), especially in diabetic patients with poor glycemic control. The other forms of xanthomas have distinct clinical and metabolic associations."

    "question": "A 23-year-old woman with moderate inflammatory acne has been using topical benzoyl peroxide and a topical retinoid with partial improvement. Her dermatologist is considering adding a novel topical retinoid that is a selective RAR-\u03b3 agonist. Which of the following medications best fits this receptor profile and is most likely to minimize off-target effects related to other RAR or RXR subtypes?",
    "choices": [
      "Isotretinoin",
      "Tazarotene",
      "Acitretin",
      "Tretinoin",
      "Trifarotene"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "Trifarotene is a newly approved topical retinoid that is distinguished by its highly selective agonism for the retinoic acid receptor-\u03b3 (RAR-\u03b3)\u2014the predominant RAR subtype in the skin\u2014without activity toward RAR-\u03b1, RAR-\u03b2, or any RXR subtypes. This receptor selectivity is expected to enhance efficacy and safety in acne compared to less selective retinoids. Tretinoin, tazarotene, and isotretinoin act broadly across retinoid receptors, and acitretin primarily affects different pathways. Therefore, trifarotene is the best choice given the scenario."

    "question": "A 27-year-old sexually active man presents with a 10-day history of a single painless genital ulcer that spontaneously resolved, followed by the onset of tender inguinal lymphadenopathy with overlying erythema and fluctuation. He notes some constitutional symptoms, including fever and malaise. He denies dysuria or urethral discharge. Examination reveals fluctuant, tender, matted lymph nodes in the right inguinal region (bubo formation), with evidence of a healing scar at the site of the previous ulcer. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism for his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Treponema pallidum",
      "Chlamydia trachomatis (L1-L3 serovars)",
      "Haemophilus ducreyi",
      "Klebsiella granulomatis",
      "Herpes simplex virus type 2"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario is characteristic of lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV), caused by Chlamydia trachomatis serovars L1-L3. LGV typically presents initially with a small, often painless genital ulcer that heals spontaneously, followed by tender, matted inguinal lymphadenopathy (bubo formation) and systemic symptoms. Treponema pallidum causes syphilis, usually with a painless chancre and non-tender lymphadenopathy. Haemophilus ducreyi produces painful ulcers and painful lymphadenopathy (chancroid). Klebsiella granulomatis causes granuloma inguinale, which features beefy red ulcers with little lymphadenopathy. Herpes simplex presents with painful vesicles and ulcerations, not the sequence described here."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought in by his parents due to severe blistering and erosions on the face and hands after minimal sun exposure. His urine has appeared red since birth. Multiple scars and mutilation are present on the ears and fingertips. On examination, there is noticeable hypertrichosis over the cheeks, severe scarring in sun-exposed areas, and both primary and some erupted permanent teeth display a pink-red fluorescence under Wood\u2019s lamp. Laboratory studies show hemolytic anemia. Which of the following findings would most likely help distinguish this patient\u2019s condition from drug-induced pseudoporphyria?",
    "choices": [
      "Hypertrichosis and erythrodontia with coral-red fluorescence of teeth",
      "Photosensitive blistering on sun-exposed skin",
      "Elevated urine and serum porphyrin levels",
      "Scarring and mutilation of sun-exposed sites",
      "Red discoloration of urine since birth"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Hypertrichosis and erythrodontia with characteristic coral-red fluorescence of the teeth under Wood\u2019s lamp are unique and diagnostic for congenital erythropoietic porphyria (CEP, Gunther\u2019s disease), and not seen in drug-induced pseudoporphyria. While both conditions may feature blistering, scarring, mutilation, and red urine (often a clinical clue in CEP), only CEP presents with erythrodontia and severe mutilating photosensitivity from birth due to a specific enzyme deficiency. Pseudoporphyria lacks these dental and hair findings, and is most often associated with medications."

    "question": "A 6-year-old child from a rural village in West Africa presents with painless, hypopigmented macules and plaques on the extremities, some of which show slight atrophy. The mother states the child has had these lesions for over a year, and over time, the patches have slowly enlarged. There are no systemic symptoms, joint pain, or nerve thickening, and sensation in the patches is intact. A skin biopsy reveals superficial and deep dermal perivascular infiltrates composed mainly of plasma cells and lymphocytes, with occasional spiral-shaped bacteria on Warthin-Starry staining. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Endemic syphilis (bejel)",
      "Yaws",
      "Leprosy",
      "Pinta",
      "Onchocerciasis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Yaws, caused by Treponema pallidum subspecies pertenue, typically affects children in tropical regions, causing chronic painless papules and hypopigmented plaques, often with characteristic plasma cell infiltrates and detection of spiral-shaped bacteria on special stains. Leprosy presents with nerve involvement and sensory loss, which this case lacks. Pinta would show more pigmentary changes but is found in Central/South America. Onchocerciasis gives papular/pruritic eruptions. Endemic syphilis (bejel) mainly affects mucous membranes and is rare in West Africa."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled diabetes mellitus and end-stage renal disease on hemodialysis presents with intensely pruritic skin lesions on his lower legs. He describes the lesions as initially developing as small papules that evolve over several weeks, often occurring at areas where he has scratched. On examination, there are multiple 5-8 mm keratotic papules with central umbilication and overlying crust, some of which are healing and others are newly formed. He denies any recent medications or new exposures. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Lichen simplex chronicus",
      "Acquired perforating dermatosis (Kyrle\u2019s disease)",
      "Prurigo nodularis",
      "Psoriasis vulgaris",
      "Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Acquired perforating dermatosis (Kyrle\u2019s disease) is associated with chronic renal failure, diabetes mellitus, and pruritus. It presents in adults, often at areas of trauma, as keratotic papules 5-8 mm in diameter with central umbilication or crust. Lesions are most common on the lower legs and can appear follicular-based. Histologically, necrotic material (primarily collagen) is seen perforating through the epidermis. Lichen simplex chronicus and prurigo nodularis are both associated with chronic scratching, but their classic morphologies and associations are different. Psoriasis and epidermolysis bullosa acquisita do not typically present with these clinical or epidemiological features."

    "question": "A 2-year-old child is brought to the dermatology clinic with a history of multiple firm, painless subcutaneous nodules over the scalp and trunk. The child also has marked gum hypertrophy, joint contractures, and chronic diarrhea. Examination reveals thickened skin and papulonodular lesions. Family history is unremarkable. A skin biopsy shows deposition of hyalinized, eosinophilic material in the dermis, and marked adipocyte entrapment. Laboratory findings reveal chronic anemia, and the child has had recurrent respiratory infections. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Juvenile hyaline fibromatosis (JHF)",
      "Infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH)",
      "Linear morphea",
      "Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome",
      "Neonatal scleroderma"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a young child with multiple subcutaneous nodules, gum hypertrophy, joint contractures, diarrhea, recurrent infections, and histological evidence of hyalinized material with adipocyte entrapment. These findings are characteristic of infantile systemic hyalinosis (ISH), a severe, systemic form of hyaline fibromatosis syndrome, associated with early-onset, multi-organ involvement, and a poor prognosis. The juvenile form (JHF) presents later and is less severe with minimal systemic symptoms. The findings are not consistent with linear morphea (which may mimic some features but lacks systemic involvement and specific histology), Beare-Stevenson cutis gyrata syndrome (distinct craniofacial anomalies), or neonatal scleroderma (different pathology and clinical features)."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents to the dermatologist with patchy hair loss on the scalp that began suddenly several weeks ago. Examination reveals several well-demarcated patches of nonscarring alopecia. Dermoscopy shows yellow dots, and no broken hairs or exclamation mark hairs are seen. A scalp biopsy is performed and reveals marked peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate (\u201cswarm of bees\u201d) with increased telogen hairs, along with dilated infundibula. Which histopathologic finding would most help distinguish this condition from androgenetic alopecia?",
    "choices": [
      "Scant perifollicular inflammation with increased miniaturized follicles",
      "Marked increase in telogen count with peribulbar lymphocytic inflammation",
      "Total loss of sebaceous glands with fibrosis and reduced hair count",
      "Diffuse miniaturization of hair follicles without peribulbar infiltrate",
      "Dilated infundibula with neutrophilic infiltrate and follicular rupture"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The case describes alopecia areata, which features a prominent peribulbar lymphocytic infiltrate ('swarm of bees') and markedly increased telogen count, especially in chronic disease. Androgenetic alopecia lacks the peribulbar inflammation and shows only slight telogen elevation and miniaturization. Scarring alopecias present with sebaceous gland loss and fibrosis. Miniaturization without inflammation is seen in androgenetic alopecia, while neutrophils and follicular rupture are features of suppurative folliculitis."

    "question": "A 68-year-old man with a history of renal transplant is referred for evaluation of a rapidly growing, ulcerated nodule on his left forearm. He has received chronic immunosuppression with tacrolimus and prednisone for 8 years. On examination, there is a 2 cm exophytic, erythematous nodule with central ulceration and crusting. No lymphadenopathy is present. A biopsy shows features consistent with moderately differentiated cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Following wide local excision with clear margins, within 4 months, new tender, erythematous plaques and papules develop near the surgical scar. The patient is started on PD-1 inhibitor immunotherapy. Two months later, he develops pruritic, dusky papules and erosions on the trunk, oral mucosa, and genitalia. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management of his new cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate high-potency topical corticosteroids and monitor response.",
      "Discontinue PD-1 inhibitor and start systemic corticosteroids.",
      "Add oral antihistamines for symptomatic relief and continue immunotherapy.",
      "Perform immediate skin biopsy to rule out recurrent cSCC and continue immunotherapy.",
      "Treat with oral antibiotics to prevent secondary infection."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient, who developed mucocutaneous erosions involving multiple sites, after beginning immunotherapy for cSCC, is most likely experiencing a severe immune-related adverse event (irAE) in the form of immunotherapy-induced lichenoid or bullous pemphigoid-like eruption. Severe (grade 3/4) cutaneous irAEs, especially those with mucosal involvement, warrant prompt discontinuation of the PD-1 inhibitor and initiation of systemic corticosteroids. High-potency topical steroids are inadequate for severe, widespread, or mucosal disease. Oral antihistamines provide only symptomatic relief and do not address the underlying immune reaction. Skin biopsy may be helpful but should not delay treatment in severe cases. Antibiotics are not indicated unless there is clear evidence of secondary infection. Therefore, the most appropriate initial management is to discontinue immunotherapy and start systemic corticosteroids."

On examination, you note grouped vesicles on the conchal bowl and external auditory canal of the right ear. She reports subjective hearing loss and tinnitus on the same side. She denies any recent trauma or tick bites. Which of the following best explains the pathogenesis of her current presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Reactivation of varicella-zoster virus in the nasociliary branch of the ophthalmic division of trigeminal nerve",
      "Primary herpes simplex virus-1 infection of the trigeminal ganglion",

      "Inadequate maternal antibody transfer leading to neonatal varicella",
      "Epstein-Barr virus infection of B lymphocytes causing cranial neuropathy"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This woman is presenting with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, characterized by VZV reactivation in the geniculate ganglion of the facial nerve (choice 3). This results in facial paralysis, ear pain, and vesicular rash on the external ear/canal. Hutchinson's sign (choice 1) refers to involvement of the nasociliary branch with ocular risk, but this is not the classic Ramsay Hunt scenario. Primary HSV-1 and EBV infections do not present with this triad. Inadequate maternal antibody transfer (choice 4) describes neonatal varicella, which is unrelated."

    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "This patient meets clinical criteria for suspected infective endocarditis, given his risk factors, classic dermatological findings (Osler nodes and Janeway lesions), and new murmur. While transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) is often the first-line imaging, TEE (transesophageal echocardiography) is superior in detecting vegetations and cardiac complications of endocarditis, especially in high-risk or technically difficult patients. Therefore, TEE is the most appropriate next diagnostic step to confirm the diagnosis."

On further questioning, he reports weakness in his grip and frequent muscle cramps. On examination, you note four subcentimeter, hard, mobile nodules on his cheeks and upper arms as well as mild facial muscle wasting and frontal balding. Family history reveals his father had similar nodules and also died of cardiac arrhythmia in his thirties. Which underlying syndrome best explains his clinical presentation?",

The lesions are firm and non-tender, ranging from 1\u20132 cm in diameter. He reports mild pruritus but no systemic symptoms. Skin biopsy demonstrates a dermal infiltrate of monotonous small lymphocytes sparing the epidermis, with scattered larger forms. Immunohistochemistry reveals CD20+, CD5+, and CD23+ staining. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Mycosis fungoides",
      "Leukemia cutis",
      "Granuloma annulare",
      "Cutaneous metastasis from carcinoma",
      "Lymphomatoid papulosis"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario, past medical history of chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and the described histology with a dermal infiltrate of monotonous small lymphocytes sparing the epidermis, and positivity for CD20, CD5, and CD23 support a diagnosis of leukemia cutis. Mycosis fungoides would demonstrate epidermotropism and atypical T-cells, not the B-cell markers described. Granuloma annulare is a granulomatous process without lymphoid infiltrates. Cutaneous metastases show aggregates of malignant epithelial cells.

Histology displays nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading and connection to the overlying epidermis. Immunohistochemistry reveals diffuse Bcl-2 positivity. Genetic analysis of the lesion is most likely to reveal which of the following findings?",

    "explanation": "The clinical, dermoscopic, and histologic features described are classic for basal cell carcinoma (BCC). The most common genetic event in BCC is loss of heterozygosity and/or truncating mutations in the PTCH gene, a tumor suppressor in the Hedgehog pathway. Secondary, but less frequent, are point mutations in the p53 gene. The other listed mutations are associated with different neoplasms (e.g., BRAF V600E in melanoma, EWSR1-ATF1 in clear cell sarcoma, CDKN2A in familial melanoma, and t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma)."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "In dermatitis herpetiformis, the optimal site for direct immunofluorescence is perilesional skin at least 0.5 cm away from a blister, and the specimen should be placed in Michel\u2019s medium. This maximizes the chance of detecting the granular IgA deposits characteristic of the disease. Biopsying the central ulcer or intact blister may destroy key immunoreactants. Normal-appearing distant skin or the edge of a new blister are appropriate for other conditions but not optimal for dermatitis herpetiformis. Formalin fixation and frozen sections are not appropriate for immunofluorescence studies."

Biopsy shows septal panniculitis and is negative for organisms. Erythema induratum, a lobular panniculitis often associated with vasculitis, would show lobular involvement and possible caseation necrosis.

Histopathology reveals suprabasilar keratinocytes downregulating K1/K10 expression and upregulating another set of keratins specifically associated with a hyperproliferative state. Which additional immunohistochemical marker would most likely be increased in this patient's lesions?",
    "choices": [
      "Filaggrin",
      "K6",
      "K14",
      "Loricrin",
      "Involucrin"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "In conditions like psoriasis, the reference notes that suprabasilar keratinocytes downregulate K1/K10 (markers of terminal differentiation) and upregulate K6/K16. K6 is specifically highlighted as a marker of a hyperproliferative state in these diseases, whereas the other markers are not primarily associated with hyperproliferation."

    "question": "A 52-year-old woman presents with increasing facial wrinkling, hyperpigmentation, and rough texture, all consistent with chronic photoaging. She expresses concern about the 'aged' appearance of her skin and requests non-invasive treatment options. On examination, the patient has type II Fitzpatrick skin, fine periocular wrinkles, and mild lentigines. She has a history of regular sun exposure and is otherwise healthy. She is seeking a topical agent to improve her overall facial skin appearance, particularly fine lines, hyperpigmentation, and texture. She asks you to recommend a scientifically-supported topical therapy with low irritation potential. Which of the following is the most appropriate recommendation based on current evidence?",
    "choices": [
      "Topical tretinoin cream",
      "Topical niacinamide",
      "Topical hydroquinone",
      "Topical vitamin C (ascorbic acid)",
      "Fractional ablative laser therapy"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Topical niacinamide (vitamin B3) has been demonstrated in clinical studies (see reference E, Berge CA) to improve multiple features of aging facial skin, including fine wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, and skin texture, with a favorable safety and tolerability profile, especially compared to agents like tretinoin, which are more irritating. Hydroquinone primarily targets hyperpigmentation, vitamin C is less effective for textural improvement, and ablative lasers are invasive. Niacinamide is thus the most appropriate and evidence-based topical choice for a patient wanting non-invasive, multidimensional improvement with minimal irritation."

    "question": "A 28-year-old male from an endemic region presents to the clinic with several hypopigmented, anesthetic macules and plaques on his arms and trunk. The lesions have well-defined borders. Sensation is reduced over these lesions, and peripheral nerve thickening is noted. No systemic symptoms are present. Slit-skin smears reveal few acid-fast bacilli. A lepromin skin test is strongly positive. Which immunological profile most accurately describes his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Predominantly Th2 cytokine profile with high IL-4 and IL-10",
      "Strong Th1 cytokine profile with IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2 predominance",
      "Typical Th1/Th2 balance with no clear dominance",
      "Suppressed cellular and humoral responses with absent cytokine response",
      "Predominantly Th17 cytokine activation"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This case describes a patient with tuberculoid leprosy, indicated by few well-defined lesions, anesthetic macules, nerve involvement, few bacilli, and a positive lepromin test. Tuberculoid leprosy is characterized by a strong Th1-type immune response, involving cytokines like IFN-\u03b3 and IL-2, leading to containment of bacilli. In contrast, lepromatous leprosy is associated with a Th2 response (IL-4, IL-10), numerous bacilli, and a negative lepromin test."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents with a rapidly enlarging, asymmetrical pigmented lesion on his upper back, measuring 1.3 cm in diameter. The lesion has irregular borders and has developed ulceration over the past month. There are no palpable regional lymph nodes. You suspect melanoma and are considering tissue diagnosis for histologic confirmation. Which of the following is the most appropriate initial management to obtain a tissue diagnosis and stage the lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Punch biopsy of the thickest part of the lesion only",
      "Excisional biopsy with narrow margins to include the entire lesion",
      "Shave biopsy of the central, most pigmented area",
      "Incisional biopsy of a representative section from the lesion's edge",
      "Wide local excision with 2-cm margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Excisional biopsy with narrow margins is the diagnostic procedure of choice for suspected melanoma. It allows for complete lesional assessment, accurate measurement of Breslow thickness, and evaluation of ulceration, all necessary for proper staging. Incisional biopsy is reserved for cases when excision is unfeasible, such as very large lesions or those in cosmetically sensitive areas. Punch or shave biopsies may fail to capture the full depth or characteristics needed for staging. Wide local excision with 2-cm margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy is therapeutic and performed after the diagnosis and initial staging are established."

    "question": "A 25-year-old sexually active male presents with multiple grouped vesicular lesions on an erythematous base on his penis, associated with fever and tender inguinal lymphadenopathy. He reports a similar episode 6 months ago that resolved spontaneously. He denies any oral lesions, prior medication changes, or systemic symptoms such as jaundice, sore throat, or rash. His partner had a recent history of painful oral ulcers. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis and etiologic agent responsible for his symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Primary genital infection with HSV-1 (Herpes Simplex Virus type 1)",
      "Primary genital infection with HSV-2 (Herpes Simplex Virus type 2)",
      "Genital lesions secondary to HHV-3 (Varicella-zoster virus)",
      "Genital lesions as part of DRESS (associated with HHV-6)",
      "Genital Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (associated with HHV-8)"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes recurrent grouped vesicular lesions on the penis with systemic symptoms and a history of similar self-resolving episodes. HSV-2 is classically associated with genital herpes, although HSV-1 can also cause these lesions. However, recurrent genital outbreaks are more frequently caused by HSV-2. The lack of features suggestive of varicella-zoster (dermatomal pattern), DRESS (systemic drug reaction with rash and eosinophilia), or Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma (typically violaceous plaques in immunosuppressed patients) makes these less likely. Thus, the most probable diagnosis is recurrent genital herpes due to HSV-2 (HHV-2)."

    "question": "A 10-year-old boy presents with multiple progressively enlarging, compressible blue-red papules and nodules scattered over his trunk and extremities, present since early childhood. Some lesions are tender, and he occasionally reports gastrointestinal bleeding. Physical examination reveals several soft, rubbery, nonpulsatile lesions of varying size, most of which partially empty when compressed. There is no limb overgrowth or skeletal deformity. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Diffuse capillary malformation with overgrowth (DCMO)",
      "Maffucci syndrome",
      "Blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (Bean syndrome)",
      "Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome",
      "Sturge-Weber syndrome"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes multiple compressible, rubbery blue-red nodules that are tender and associated with GI bleeding, characteristic of blue rubber bleb nevus syndrome (Bean syndrome), which consists of venous malformations affecting the skin and internal organs. DCMO presents with extensive capillary malformations and mild overgrowth, Maffucci syndrome involves vascular hamartomas and enchondromas (noted by skeletal involvement), and Klippel-Trenaunay and Sturge-Weber syndromes have different features such as limb overgrowth or facial capillary malformations, respectively."

    "question": "A 2-week-old healthy neonate presents with multiple 1-3 mm pustules on a non-erythematous background, some of which have ruptured leaving hyperpigmented macules, predominantly on the chin, neck, back, and shins. There are no signs of systemic illness, and the infant is feeding well. A Wright stain of the pustule content reveals neutrophils, but no organisms are seen on Gram stain. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Erythema toxicum neonatorum",
      "Transient neonatal pustular melanosis",
      "Bullous impetigo",
      "Acropustulosis of infancy",
      "Congenital candidiasis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Transient neonatal pustular melanosis presents at birth or in the first few days of life with superficial pustules that rupture easily, leaving hyperpigmented macules with a collarette of scale. Lesions are most often found on the chin, neck, and shins, and are non-erythematous. In contrast, erythema toxicum neonatorum features erythematous papules and pustules with eosinophils on Wright stain. Bullous impetigo and congenital candidiasis would show organisms on the Gram stain, and acropustulosis of infancy is rare in the neonatal period and typically involves the hands and feet."

His mother reports that he now has difficulty with handwriting and frequently trips while walking. On exam, he has dysarthria, truncal ataxia, and telangiectatic vessels visible over the bulbar conjunctivae. He has eczema-like rashes on the extensor surfaces of the arms, mild hepatosplenomegaly, and multiple small petechiae on his lower limbs. There is a history of recurrent bronchitis and sinusitis requiring antibiotics. Laboratory findings reveal elevated alpha-fetoprotein, low IgA and IgE, and persistent lymphopenia. Two maternal aunts had premenopausal breast cancer. Which of the following is the most likely underlying pathogenic mechanism for his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Defective chromosomal strand break repair due to AR gene mutation",
      "Chronic granulomatous inflammation with impaired neutrophil oxidative burst",
      "Aberrant DNA mismatch repair leading to microsatellite instability",
      "Congenital deficiency of complement components C2 and C4",
      "Impaired TGF-\u03b2 signaling due to endoglin gene mutation"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical picture is classic for ataxia-telangiectasia: early-onset cerebellar ataxia, telangiectasias of the conjunctiva and skin, recurrent viral/bacterial infections (secondary to IgA-IgE deficiency, lymphopenia, thymic hypoplasia), increased risk of malignancy (family history of breast ca), and elevated alpha-fetoprotein. The underlying defect is a mutation in the ATM gene, which is responsible for sensing DNA double-strand breaks and activating chromosomal repair processes. This leads to increased sensitivity to ionizing radiation and increased incidence of lymphoid and breast malignancies. The other options describe different immune or genetic disorders but do not fit this constellation of findings."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man presents with slowly progressive pruritic papules on his shins and forearms for the past 2 years. Physical examination reveals clusters of shiny, skin-colored to brown, flat-topped papules coalescing into plaques displaying a rippled pattern. There is no palpable lymphadenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, or mucosal involvement. Laboratory tests are unremarkable. Skin biopsy shows amorphous, eosinophilic material deposited in the papillary dermis with positive Congo red staining and apple-green birefringence under polarized light. Immunohistochemistry is negative for light chains and serum protein electrophoresis is normal. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Systemic AL (primary) amyloidosis",
      "Lichen amyloidosis (a form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis)",
      "AA (secondary) systemic amyloidosis",
      "Macular amyloidosis",
      "Nodular cutaneous amyloidosis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes chronic, itchy papules with a rippled pattern on the shins and forearms, characteristic of lichen amyloidosis. Histology reveals amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis, staining positive with Congo red and exhibiting apple-green birefringence. Normal serum and lack of systemic symptoms or findings rule out systemic amyloidoses (AL and AA types). Lichen amyloidosis is a form of primary cutaneous amyloidosis, distinct from macular (which shows macular hyperpigmentation without papules) and nodular forms (which typically have more prominent dermal nodules and may show light-chain immunoreactivity)."

He also reports lifelong heat intolerance, but no history of dental abnormalities. Examination reveals non-scarring alopecia on the scalp and eyebrows, as well as dystrophic nails. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome",
      "Dyskeratosis congenita",
      "Dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis",
      "Hair-nail ectodermal dysplasia (keratin 85 mutation)",
      "Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The presence of non-cicatricial alopecia, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar keratoderma, hypohidrosis, and adermatoglyphia (absence of fingerprints), without dental abnormalities, points towards dermatopathia pigmentosa reticularis (DPR). DPR is caused by keratin 14 mutations and shares several features with Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome (such as adermatoglyphia, palmoplantar keratoderma, and hypohidrosis), but alopecia is seen only in DPR, while dental abnormalities are only seen in Naegeli-Franceschetti-Jadassohn syndrome. Hair-nail ectodermal dysplasia (keratin 85 mutation) also causes nail fragility and alopecia, but is not associated with loss of fingerprints or palmoplantar keratoderma."

She describes fever and malaise accompanying each new flare. On examination, there are well-demarcated, red, edematous plaques with a pseudovesicular appearance. Some areas demonstrate a targetoid morphology. There is no mucosal involvement. Laboratory tests reveal a neutrophil-predominant leukocytosis and increased inflammatory markers. Skin biopsy demonstrates a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate with prominent papillary dermal edema but no evidence of vasculitis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Erythema multiforme",
      "Sweet syndrome (acute febrile neutrophilic dermatosis)",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum",
      "Urticaria",
      "Eosinophilic cellulitis (Wells syndrome)"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Sweet syndrome is characterized by the sudden onset of painful, erythematous plaques or nodules, usually accompanied by fever and neutrophilia. Histopathology reveals a dense dermal neutrophilic infiltrate without true vasculitis, which matches this case. Erythema multiforme and urticaria usually show epidermal involvement or perivascular lymphocytic infiltrates, not dense neutrophils. Pyoderma gangrenosum typically presents as ulcerative lesions, not pseudovesicular plaques. Eosinophilic cellulitis would show a predominance of eosinophils, not neutrophils, on biopsy."

    "question": "A 2-week-old infant is brought to the dermatologist for evaluation of severe blistering and erosions that began shortly after birth. The infant has blisters on the trunk and extremities as well as on the oral mucosa, with areas of denuded skin. On examination, there is evidence of mitten deformities (fusion of fingers), poor weight gain, and oral intake is limited by painful, ulcerated lesions. The parents note a family history of consanguinity but no similar skin conditions. Which of the following findings on electron microscopy is most likely in this child?",
    "choices": [
      "Absence of anchoring fibrils in the basement membrane",
      "Absence of desmosomes within the keratinocytes",
      "Intracellular keratin filament clumping in basal keratinocytes",
      "Absence of hemidesmosomes at the dermal-epidermal junction",
      "Widespread acantholysis with suprabasal cleft formation"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes recessive dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (RDEB), Hallopeau-Siemens type, which presents at birth with severe blistering, mitten deformities, poor growth, and mucosal involvement. RDEB is caused by a defect in type VII collagen, resulting in absent anchoring fibrils as seen on electron microscopy. Other options describe findings more typical of different blistering diseases (e.g., defective desmosomes in pemphigus vulgaris, hemidesmosomes in junctional EB, keratin filament clumping in epidermolysis bullosa simplex, and suprabasal clefting in pemphigus)."

    "question": "A 2-year-old boy is brought in by his parents due to patchy hair loss on his scalp, first noticed three months ago. On examination, there are well-circumscribed areas of non-scarring alopecia. The parents are concerned about permanent baldness. You recall that the formation of new hair follicles ceases after a certain point in development. Based on your understanding of hair follicle embryology and follicular morphogenesis, which of the following best explains why new hairs cannot regenerate in these bald patches in adulthood?",
    "choices": [
      "Hair follicles are entirely mesodermal in origin and adult mesoderm loses regenerative properties after birth.",
      "Hair follicle formation requires a unique fetal stem cell population that is depleted at birth.",
      "Interactions between epithelial and mesenchymal cells, crucial for follicle development, only occur during specific stages of embryogenesis.",
      "Hair papilla (the source of new follicles) persists only during the prenatal period and degenerates thereafter.",
      "The process of follicle peg formation depends on amniotic fluid growth factors that are absent postnatally."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Hair follicle development (folliculogenesis) is tightly restricted to embryogenesis, as new follicles do not form in adult skin. This restriction is due to the specific bidirectional signaling between epithelial (ectodermal) and mesenchymal (mostly dermal mesodermal) cells, which only occurs at certain stages of embryonic development. After birth, this interaction cannot be reinitiated, which is why new follicles cannot be formed and patchy hair loss is permanent if follicles are lost."

    "question": "A 52-year-old man presents with thickened, yellowish toenails that have been progressively worsening over a year. He noticed that the changes started distally and have been advancing proximally, making it difficult to trim his nails. Physical examination reveals subungual debris and distal onycholysis. Direct microscopy with potassium hydroxide shows septate hyphae. He has no history of immunosuppression. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",
    "choices": [
      "Trichophyton rubrum",
      "Trichophyton mentagrophytes",
      "Epidermophyton floccosum",
      "Candida albicans",
      "Aspergillus species"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Distal subungual onychomycosis, the most common pattern of tinea unguium, is most frequently caused by Trichophyton rubrum. T. mentagrophytes and E. floccosum can also cause this condition but are less common. Candida and non-dermatophyte molds like Aspergillus are more likely in immunocompromised hosts or in fingernail involvement."

The lesions occasionally ulcerate and heal with atrophic scars. She reports mild malaise but is otherwise healthy. She has a history of recurrent episodes during the winter months but is not on any medications and denies trauma, recent infection, or travel. Examination reveals multiple firm, tender nodules on the calves with some areas of scarring. Laboratory studies show elevated ESR but are otherwise unremarkable. A skin biopsy reveals lobular panniculitis with granulomatous infiltrates, vasculitis of medium-sized vessels, and fat necrosis. Special stains for acid-fast bacilli and fungi are negative. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Erythema induratum (nodular vasculitis)",
      "Erythema nodosum",
      "Nodular melanoma",
      "Nodular amyloidosis",
      "Nodular fasciitis"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Erythema induratum, also known as nodular vasculitis, presents as tender nodules on the lower legs that may ulcerate and heal with scarring. Histology shows lobular panniculitis with granulomatous infiltrates and vasculitis of small- and medium-sized vessels. Erythema nodosum is mainly septal panniculitis without vasculitis or granulomas. Nodular melanoma and nodular amyloidosis have distinct clinical and histologic features, and nodular fasciitis is a rapidly growing soft tissue lesion unrelated to subcutaneous vasculitis."

The lesion is asymmetric and slightly protuberant, measuring 3 cm in diameter. A punch biopsy reveals a dermal spindle cell neoplasm, arranged in a storiform pattern, with ill-defined margins invading into the subcutaneous fat in a lace-like manner. The spindle cells are monomorphic. Immunohistochemistry shows CD34 positivity and factor XIIIa negativity. What is the most appropriate next step in the management of this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Observation with serial monitoring since the tumor is low grade and grows slowly.",
      "Referral for Mohs micrographic surgery to ensure complete margin control.",
      "Initiation of radiotherapy as the primary treatment modality.",
      "Wide local excision with 1-cm margins and closure.",
      "Systemic chemotherapy prior to surgical intervention due to high metastatic risk."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP) is a low-grade sarcoma that characteristically grows slowly but invades locally and has a high risk of local recurrence if not adequately excised. Mohs micrographic surgery is the treatment of choice for DFSP because it maximizes tissue conservation and margin control, significantly reducing the risk of recurrence compared to standard wide local excision. While wide local excision is sometimes performed, Mohs surgery is preferred for optimal outcomes. Observation is inappropriate due to the tumor's locally aggressive nature; systemic therapies are reserved for unresectable or metastatic disease."

    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a firm, slowly growing plaque with histopathologic features of a storiform spindle cell pattern infiltrating into fat. CD34 positivity and factor XIIIa negativity strongly favor dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Dermatofibroma is typically factor XIIIa positive and only rarely invades subcutis. Atypical fibroxanthoma generally arises on sun-damaged skin and lacks deep fat infiltration. Angiofibromas typically present as small, red papules, often on the face. Epithelioid sarcoma is rare and typically exhibits epithelioid rather than spindle cell morphology with a different immunoprofile."

She reports frequent facial flushing, particularly when drinking hot beverages or after exercise. Recently, she has developed persistent hard, nonpitting edema of her upper cheeks and eyelids. Previous diagnoses of cellulitis led to multiple courses of antibiotics with minimal improvement. On examination, you note pronounced facial edema without tenderness, and no evidence of fluctuance or draining sinuses. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",

    "explanation": "This is a classic presentation of persistent edema of rosacea, also known as rosacea lymphedema or Morbihan\u2019s disease. The correct treatment is a combination of oral isotretinoin and prednisone. This form of hard, nonpitting facial edema is frequently misdiagnosed as cellulitis, but resistant to antibiotics and not responsive to corticosteroids. Topical metronidazole is effective for papulopustular rosacea but will not address the edema. High-potency steroids may worsen rosacea.

Primary Raynaud\u2019s is due to vasospasm, is reversible, and lacks the vascular remodeling and tissue injury seen in secondary forms. It may be associated with migraine. First-line treatment is lifestyle modification (avoiding triggers); calcium channel blockers are used if symptoms remain problematic. Immunosuppression is reserved for secondary Raynaud\u2019s due to autoimmune connective tissue diseases.

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with numerous dome-shaped, erythematous papules and pustules on his forehead, chest, and back. He reports rapid onset of the eruptions, which appeared within two weeks after starting a new job at a chemical plant where he handles chlorinated hydrocarbons. He denies any previous history of acne or family history of severe acne. On examination, comedones are sparse, and the lesions are monomorphic. There is no evidence of scarring or keloid formation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Drug-induced acne",
      "Industrial acne",
      "Acne keloidalis",
      "Neonatal acne",
      "Acquired perforating dermatosis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The rapid onset of monomorphic papules and pustules without comedones, in the setting of work exposure to chlorinated hydrocarbons, strongly suggests industrial acne. Drug-induced acne can present similarly but is more often linked to medications. Acne keloidalis appears on the scalp/neck with scarring. Neonatal acne affects infants, and acquired perforating dermatosis is unrelated to acute pustular eruptions."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with an eczematous rash on his forearms after hiking through dense brush. He reports pruritic, erythematous patches with vesicles developing within 24 hours after exposure. Biopsy reveals Langerhans cells within the epidermis, expressing CD1a and langerin (CD207), and interacting closely with nearby keratinocytes. Which of the following immunologic events is most directly responsible for the development of his skin eruption?",
    "choices": [
      "Release of preformed IgE from B cells in response to antigen",
      "Recognition of antigen presented by MHC I to CD8+ cytotoxic T cells",
      "Upregulation of E-cadherin expression by keratinocytes in response to TGF-\u03b2",
      "Presentation of processed hapten-peptide by MHC II on APCs to CD4+ T cells",
      "Constitutive expression of B7 (CD80/CD86) costimulatory molecules on Langerhans cells"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes allergic contact dermatitis\u2014a classic example of a Type IV (delayed-type) hypersensitivity reaction. Here, Langerhans cells act as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) by processing the contact hapten and presenting it via MHC II molecules to CD4+ T-helper cells, which then orchestrate the immune response. Langerhans cells only express B7 (CD80/CD86) costimulatory molecules after activation by antigen, not constitutively. IgE and B cell responses (answer A) are relevant to immediate (Type I) hypersensitivity, while MHC I/CD8+ cytotoxic T cell pathways (answer B) are more relevant to viral or tumor immunity. Upregulation of E-cadherin by TGF-\u03b2 (answer C) maintains Langerhans cells in an immature state but does not directly lead to clinical eczematous reactions."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents with a sudden eruption of dusky red macules and targetoid papules on her trunk and extremities, some with central vesiculation. She reports no recent new medications but describes having a mild upper respiratory infection a week ago. Skin biopsy shows interface dermatitis with basal vacuolar change and lymphocytic infiltration along the dermoepidermal junction, without significant necrotic keratinocytes or eosinophils. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Fixed drug eruption",
      "Erythema multiforme",
      "Lichen planus",
      "Graft-versus-host disease",
      "Lupus erythematosus"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes targetoid lesions following an upper respiratory infection, suggesting erythema multiforme (EM). The histopathological findings of interface dermatitis with vacuolar change and lymphocytic infiltrate are consistent with EM. Fixed drug eruption typically presents with solitary or few lesions at recurrent, same sites upon drug exposure and more necrotic keratinocytes. Lichen planus shows dense band-like lymphocytic infiltrate. Graft-versus-host disease and lupus can both show interface dermatitis but would generally have different clinical settings or systemic involvement."

    "question": "A 61-year-old man presents with a 4-month history of progressive, pruritic, erythematous papules and plaques on his trunk and proximal extremities. He also notes unintentional weight loss and night sweats. On examination, you see thin violaceous papules coalescing into annular plaques with non-scaling, raised borders and central clearing. There is no mucosal involvement. Past history is notable for hypertension and hyperlipidemia, but no known malignancy. Laboratory studies reveal mild anemia but are otherwise normal. Skin biopsy demonstrates granulomatous infiltrates in the dermis with multinucleated giant cells and palisading histiocytes, with degeneration of collagen, but no evidence of infection on special stains. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Initiate topical corticosteroids and observe for improvement",
      "Order age-appropriate malignancy screening, as this eruption may be a paraneoplastic granuloma annulare",
      "Treat empirically for cutaneous fungal infection",
      "Test for hepatitis C virus infection",
      "Refer to endocrinology for evaluation of thyroid disease"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes generalized granuloma annulare (GA) in an older adult with systemic symptoms (weight loss, night sweats, anemia). Recent research (see Mangold et al., J Am Acad Dermatol. 2018) has shown that GA, particularly of the generalized or atypical type in older adults with systemic symptoms, may be associated with underlying solid organ malignancy. Malignancy screening should be considered, as this could represent a paraneoplastic dermatosis. While topical corticosteroids may help, immediate investigation for internal malignancy is warranted. There is no evidence of fungal infection, hepatitis C, or thyroid disease in this scenario."

    "question": "A 65-year-old woman presents with multiple ill-defined, violaceous, nodular lesions on the inner aspect of her right upper arm, in an area of chronic lymphedema that has persisted for several years following mastectomy and axillary lymph node dissection for breast cancer. The lesions are indurated and have rapidly enlarged over the past two months. A biopsy shows infiltrating, anastomosing vascular channels in the dermis lined by pleomorphic, hyperchromatic endothelial cells. Immunohistochemistry reveals tumor cells positive for CD31 and CD34, but negative for vimentin. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Classic Kaposi sarcoma",
      "Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans",

      "Cutaneous metastasis of breast cancer",
      "Lymphangiosarcoma unrelated to lymphedema"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes Stewart-Treves syndrome, which is an angiosarcoma arising in chronic lymphedema, most commonly after mastectomy and lymph node dissection. The common site is the inner upper extremity, and histopathology with anastomosing vascular spaces and cells positive for CD31, CD34 but negative for vimentin is characteristic. Kaposi sarcoma would show different histopathology, while dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans and cutaneous breast metastasis would also have distinct features."

    "question": "A 56-year-old woman presents with several months of progressive muscle weakness, particularly difficulty rising from chairs and climbing stairs. She also reports a new red-purple rash over her upper eyelids and scattered scaly papules on her knuckles. On examination, she has a faint violaceous erythema over her upper back and neck, hyperkeratosis of the lateral digits, and prominent cuticular overgrowth with dilated nailfold capillaries. Laboratory investigations reveal elevated muscle enzymes and positive anti-TIF1\u03b3 antibodies. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    "choices": [
      "Obtain a skin biopsy to confirm cutaneous lupus erythematosus",
      "Initiate high-dose intravenous immunoglobulin immediately",
      "Order comprehensive malignancy screening and start systemic corticosteroids",
      "Begin topical corticosteroids for the rash and refer to physical therapy",
      "Monitor only, as cutaneous findings are self-limited"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This woman has classic clinical features of dermatomyositis (heliotrope rash, Gottron\u2019s papules/sign, photodistributed erythema, cuticular changes, hyperkeratosis), supported by laboratory findings. The presence of anti-TIF1\u03b3 antibodies is associated with an increased risk of malignancy in dermatomyositis. At diagnosis, comprehensive malignancy screening is essential, as well as initiating systemic corticosteroids to treat muscle and cutaneous inflammation. Skin biopsy is not required for classic dermatomyositis, and topical therapy alone is inadequate."

    "question": "A 27-year-old male of Mediterranean descent presents with multiple, painful erythematous nodules on his lower limbs and intermittent episodes of fever and abdominal pain. He also reports a family history of similar symptoms, and his father developed chronic kidney disease in his 40s. Laboratory studies reveal proteinuria and elevated creatinine. A skin biopsy from one of the nodules shows deposition of AA amyloid. Which of the following is the most likely underlying diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Hereditary ATTR amyloidosis (Type I)",
      "Muckle-Wells syndrome",
      "Familial Mediterranean fever",
      "Senile systemic amyloidosis",
      "AL (primary) amyloidosis"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient is presenting with recurrent painful nodules, intermittent fevers, abdominal symptoms, family history, and evidence of renal amyloidosis (proteinuria, elevated creatinine) with AA amyloid on biopsy. This constellation strongly suggests Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF), an autosomal recessive disease commonly seen in individuals of Mediterranean descent. FMF is caused by mutations in the MEFV gene and is characterized by recurrent episodes of fever and serosal inflammation (peritonitis, pleuritis), with a significant risk for secondary (AA) amyloidosis leading to renal involvement. Muckle-Wells syndrome is an autosomal dominant periodic fever syndrome associated with urticaria, hearing loss, and AA amyloidosis, but does not typically have the Mediterranean family history or abdominal attacks seen in FMF. Hereditary ATTR (transthyretin) amyloidosis manifests mainly with polyneuropathy and sometimes cardiomyopathy, not fever or serosal inflammation. Senile amyloidosis and AL amyloidosis are incorrect because their amyloid types and clinical presentations do not fit the scenario."

He is otherwise healthy, with no history of recurrent infections or underlying malignancies. He is frustrated with persistent intense pruritus and excoriated eczematous patches. His skin findings are limited to flexural surfaces. After counseling about the available biologics, which of the following agents would NOT be an appropriate prescription for his age group and indication, according to current FDA approvals?",
    "choices": [
      "Dupilumab, an IL-4 receptor \u03b1 antagonist",
      "Tralokinumab, an IL-13 inhibitor",
      "Omalizumab, an anti-IgE monoclonal antibody",
      "Systemic corticosteroids",
      "Cyclosporine"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Omalizumab is not approved for the treatment of atopic dermatitis; it is FDA approved for chronic idiopathic urticaria (and some asthma indications). The current FDA-approved biologics for atopic dermatitis are dupilumab (approved for 6 months and older) and tralokinumab (approved for ages 12 and older). The other options (systemic corticosteroids and cyclosporine) can be considered as off-label systemic immunosuppressants, though not biologics. Omalizumab\u2019s use in atopic dermatitis would be off-label and unsupported for this indication."

    "question": "A 32-year-old woman presents to your clinic complaining of persistent facial hyperpigmentation that has failed to improve with regular sunscreen and hydroquinone 4% cream for three months. She has no prior history of systemic disease, and physical exam reveals symmetric light to dark brown macules over the cheeks and upper lip, without erythema or scaling. Histopathology from a prior punch biopsy showed increased melanin deposition in the epidermis and superficial dermis, with no increase in melanocyte number. She wishes to avoid corticosteroids due to concern for skin thinning. Which of the following topical agents would be most appropriate to add, given its dual mechanism of competitively inhibiting tyrosinase and reducing free radical formation, while avoiding DNA synthesis inhibition or corticosteroid-related adverse effects?",
    "choices": [
      "Azelaic acid",
      "Tretinoin",
      "Niacinamide",
      "Kojic acid",
      "Bakuchiol"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Kojic acid both inhibits tyrosinase (the rate-limiting enzyme in melanin synthesis) and acts as an antioxidant, reducing free radical formation, making it a suitable adjuvant for persistent epidermal hyperpigmentation (such as melasma), especially in patients who wish to avoid steroid-related side effects. Azelaic acid also inhibits tyrosinase but uniquely interferes with DNA synthesis and mitochondrial enzymes. Tretinoin decreases melanosome transfer and interrupts melanin synthesis primarily, but does not have free radical-scavenging properties. Niacinamide mainly inhibits melanosome transfer to keratinocytes, and bakuchiol modulates retinoic acid receptor activity and collagen synthesis, with only possible indirect effect on melanogenesis."

He reports a history of psoriatic arthritis and that his condition worsened after a recent streptococcal throat infection. Considering the underlying immunologic mechanisms, which cytokine would be most directly responsible for promoting differentiation of na\u00efve CD4+ T cells towards a cell subset that subsequently enhances macrophage activation, increases MHC I and II expression on antigen-presenting cells, and downregulates T_H2 responses in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "IL-4",
      "IL-10",
      "IFN-\u03b3",
      "IL-17",
      "TGF-\u03b2"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "IFN-\u03b3 is a key cytokine in promoting differentiation toward T_H1 cells, which subsequently enhance macrophage activation and increase MHC I and II expression on antigen-presenting cells. IFN-\u03b3 also acts to downregulate T_H2 responses. These immunologic mechanisms are relevant in psoriasis, where a T_H1/T_H17 predominate immune response is implicated. The other options (IL-4, IL-10, IL-17, TGF-\u03b2) are more associated with T_H2 or T regulatory responses or effector function of T_H17 cells, but do not promote the differentiation and macrophage-activating functions described."

His parents mention that his teeth have a pink-red fluorescence under UV light (erythrodontia). Laboratory investigations reveal markedly elevated levels of uroporphyrin I in the urine. What is the most definitive treatment for his condition, in addition to strict sun protection?",
    "choices": [
      "Beta-carotene supplementation",
      "Bone marrow transplant",
      "Phlebotomy",

    "explanation": "This boy's presentation\u2014severe photosensitivity with blistering leading to mutilation, erythrodontia, and markedly elevated uroporphyrin I\u2014indicates congenital erythropoietic porphyria (Gunther's disease). While strict sun avoidance is essential, the only definitive treatment is bone marrow transplantation, as this addresses the underlying hematopoietic enzymatic defect. Beta-carotene and N-acetylcysteine are used in erythropoietic protoporphyria, and phlebotomy is used in porphyria cutanea tarda. Regular transfusions are not standard in Gunther\u2019s. "

On examination, the child also has evidence of atopic dermatitis, severe pruritus, and failure to thrive. Laboratory evaluation reveals hypernatremic dehydration. Light microscopy of hair shafts reveals a 'ball-in-socket' (bamboo hair) deformity. Which additional finding is MOST LIKELY to be observed in this patient as part of the underlying disorder?",
    "choices": [
      "Fine, yellow, non-inflamed papules on the extensor surfaces",

A complication of this syndrome is increased drug absorption and secondary systemic toxicities. However, the question asks for an additional feature that is likely to be found in this patient\u2019s underlying disorder, which also includes 'hypernatremic dehydration'. The listed answer\u2014palmoplantar keratoderma with retinitis pigmentosa and cerebellar ataxia\u2014refers to Refsum syndrome, which is associated with fine scaling, thickened palms/soles, retinitis pigmentosa, night blindness, and ataxia, as described in the reference."

A biopsy shows sheets of small blue round cells with scant cytoplasm and frequent mitoses. Immunohistochemically, the tumor cells are positive for synaptophysin but negative for TTF-1. Which of the following diagnoses is most likely?",
    "choices": [
      "Small-cell lung carcinoma metastatic to the skin",
      "Merkel cell carcinoma",
      "Sebaceous carcinoma",
      "Desmoplastic melanoma",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Merkel cell carcinoma is a neuroendocrine tumor of the skin that appears as a rapidly growing nodule, often on sun-exposed areas of elderly patients. Histologically, it shows sheets of small blue round cells and is immunohistochemically positive for synaptophysin (a neuroendocrine marker). Importantly, Merkel cell carcinoma is negative for TTF-1, which distinguishes it from small-cell carcinoma of the lung (which is usually TTF-1 positive). Sebaceous carcinoma and cellular neurothekeoma would have different marker profiles and morphology, while desmoplastic melanoma typically shows S100 positivity, not synaptophysin."

He also reports early satiety, mild peripheral neuropathy, and recent onset carpal tunnel syndrome. On review of systems, he has a history of hypertension, but no chronic infections or autoimmune conditions. Laboratory investigations reveal mild normocytic anemia and proteinuria. Which of the following is the most likely underlying systemic condition responsible for his dermatologic findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Primary amyloidosis (AL amyloidosis)",
      "Secondary amyloidosis due to rheumatoid arthritis",
      "Cutaneous macular amyloidosis",
      "Nodular localized cutaneous amyloidosis",
      "Hereditary amyloidosis due to familial Mediterranean fever"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical findings of periorbital swelling, petechiae, waxy papules, carpal tunnel syndrome, peripheral neuropathy, and proteinuria point to systemic AL (amyloid light chain) amyloidosis. AL amyloid deposits frequently affect the skin, causing waxy papules and purpura, and also involve the heart, GI tract, tongue, and peripheral nerves. Secondary amyloidosis (AA) is associated with chronic diseases and typically does not involve the skin. Macular amyloidosis and nodular localized cutaneous amyloidosis are limited to the skin without systemic involvement. Familial Mediterranean fever is hereditary but would also not usually explain these cutaneous findings in this demographic."

The lesions began as erythematous papules that quickly enlarged and ulcerated with violaceous, undermined borders. Repeated bacterial cultures are negative, and routine wound care has failed to improve the lesions. A punch biopsy from the edge of an ulcer reveals a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the dermis and leukocytoclasis without evidence of infectious organisms. Which of the following immunological abnormalities is most likely implicated in the pathogenesis of her condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Defective neutrophil chemotaxis",

    "explanation": "This scenario describes classic features of pyoderma gangrenosum, which is strongly associated with ulcerative colitis. The disease is characterized by a neutrophilic dermatosis and histology shows neutrophil-rich infiltrates. Its pathogenesis is most closely related to defective neutrophil chemotaxis, which leads to an exaggerated inflammatory response and resultant ulceration. The other options describe pathogenic mechanisms for different conditions: IgA immune complexes (option 2) are seen in leukocytoclastic vasculitis, mast cell degranulation (option 3) in urticaria, autoantibodies against type VII collagen (option 4) in epidermolysis bullosa acquisita, and Langerhans cell hyperplasia (option 5) in Langerhans cell histiocytosis."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient most likely has Type 2 oculocutaneous albinism (OCA2). OCA2 is the most common form of OCA and results from mutations in the OCA2 gene on chromosome 15q. Patients are typically born with minimal pigment, but the skin darkens over time. They have moderate nystagmus and visual issues. The OCA2 gene mutation can also be associated with syndromes such as Angelman and Prader-Willi due to deletions in the 15q region. The other options are associated with different forms of OCA or with syndromic albinism (e.g., Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome for HPS1 mutations)."

She is concerned about scarring and hyperpigmentation. Based on the theory of selective photothermolysis, what is the MOST critical laser parameter to minimize collateral thermal injury to the surrounding skin during her treatment?",
    "choices": [
      "Using the shortest possible wavelength to increase energy absorption in melanin",
      "Selecting a pulse duration longer than the thermal relaxation time of melanin",
      "Selecting a fluence below the threshold for lipolysis in subcutaneous tissue",
      "Using a pulse duration equal to or shorter than the thermal relaxation time of the target",
      "Employing a continuous wave laser for maximal energy delivery"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Selective photothermolysis relies on delivering laser energy that is optimally absorbed by the target chromophore (melanin in this case) without affecting surrounding tissue. The thermal relaxation time (TRT) is the time required for the target to lose half its heat to surrounding tissue. Using a pulse duration equal to or shorter than the TRT of the target ensures that the heat stays confined to the target, minimizing collateral damage. If the pulse duration is longer than the TRT or if a continuous wave laser is used, heat diffuses into surrounding tissues, increasing the risk of unwanted side effects such as scarring or hyperpigmentation, especially in darker skin types."

The ulcer developed over several weeks, starting as a papule, progressing into a nodule, and then ulcerating. Examination reveals a 3-cm ulcer with elevated edges, surrounded by hyperkeratotic skin of the soles and palms; he also has woolly hair. He returned recently from working in rivers and lakes. A biopsy of the ulcer base shows marked eosinophilic infiltrate and granuloma formation, with presence of eggs on histology. Which organism is the most likely causative agent?",
    "choices": [
      "Onchocerca volvulus",
      "Schistosoma species",
      "Filarial worm (Wuchereria bancrofti)",
      "Loa loa",
      "Taenia solium"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Schistosoma species (schistosomiasis) are flatworm parasites acquired through contact with contaminated freshwater, common in rural Africa. These can penetrate skin and migrate to tissues, causing granulomatous inflammation with egg deposition. Chronic infection may result in cutaneous ulcers, particularly in individuals in frequent contact with water bodies. Woolly hair and palmoplantar hyperkeratosis are nonspecific but sometimes seen in genetic syndromes rather than infection; nevertheless, the scenario is characteristic of cutaneous schistosomiasis. Onchocerca volvulus causes subcutaneous nodules and dermatitis, not ulcers with egg deposition. Wuchereria bancrofti and Loa loa do not usually present with ulcers or eggs in tissue biopsies. Taenia solium cysticercosis typically does not cause cutaneous ulcers."

With a negative sentinel lymph node (clinical N0), the clinical stage is IIC according to the AJCC staging system. T4b, N0, M0 = Stage IIC. T4a is reserved for >4.0 mm without ulceration, and earlier T categories (T1\u2013T3) are for thinner lesions.

Healed lesions result in severe fat atrophy and depressed scars. Pathologically, the most distinguishing features are lobular panniculitis, lymphoid follicles in the septae, and hyaline degeneration of fat. About 50% of cases have discoid lupus lesions overlying the nodules. Erythema nodosum classically presents as painful subcutaneous nodules of the shins with septal panniculitis. Tumid lupus produces non-scarring, edematous plaques with marked dermal mucin. Hypertrophic lupus presents as verrucous, keratoacanthoma-like papulonodular lesions. Scleroderma would present with skin thickening and sclerosis, not lobular panniculitis."

    "question": "A 55-year-old man presents with multiple firm, violaceous plaques and nodules on his trunk and extremities that have developed over two months. He has a history of prostate cancer diagnosed three years ago. The lesions are asymptomatic and have not responded to topical corticosteroids. Physical examination reveals no lymphadenopathy, and laboratory studies are within normal limits. A punch biopsy of a nodule shows dense dermal infiltrate of atypical epithelial cells in nests and cords, separated by collagen bundles. The infiltrating cells are positive for cytokeratin and PSA (prostate-specific antigen) immunostaining. Which of the following represents the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Cutaneous sarcoidosis",
      "Metastatic carcinoma to the skin",
      "Cutaneous leukocytoclastic vasculitis",
      "Granuloma annulare"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Metastatic carcinoma to the skin (Choice 3) is strongly supported by the clinical history of a patient with a known internal malignancy (prostate cancer) who develops violaceous plaques and nodules. The key diagnostic clues are the histologic findings of atypical epithelial cells in nests and cords with positive staining for cytokeratin and PSA, both markers of prostatic origin. Primary cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma would lack PSA positivity. Sarcoidosis is a granulomatous process without atypical epithelial cells or keratin/PSA positivity. Leukocytoclastic vasculitis and granuloma annulare do not show epithelial cell infiltrates nor the appropriate immunostaining. The scenario reflects metastatic tumor to the skin, a well-documented phenomenon especially in advanced prostate cancer, and is discussed in the referenced material under 'Metastatic Tumors to the Skin.'"

    "question": "A 27-year-old landscaper presents with a 4-week history of a painless, slowly enlarging ulcer on his right hand that developed after he accidentally pricked himself with a thorn bush. He notes that additional nodules have recently appeared in a linear pattern up his forearm. On examination, there is a 2-cm ulcer on the dorsum of the right hand with several firm subcutaneous nodules progressing proximally in a sporotrichoid pattern. A skin biopsy from a nodule reveals stellate abscesses surrounded by a granulomatous infiltrate with collections of neutrophils. Special stains show pleomorphic yeast forms, some with a characteristic cigar-shaped appearance. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cat scratch disease",
      "Lymphogranuloma venereum",
      "Sporotrichosis",
      "Cutaneous tuberculosis",
      "Mycobacterium marinum infection"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient's presentation of painless ulcer followed by nodular lymphangitic spread is classic for sporotrichosis, often due to traumatic inoculation by environmental material such as thorns. Histology showing stellate abscesses with granulomatous inflammation and yeast forms (some cigar-shaped) is highly characteristic of Sporothrix schenckii infection. Other nodular lymphangitic infections (e.g., cat scratch, M. marinum infection) are considered differential diagnoses, but the unique histopathology with cigar-shaped yeast forms points to sporotrichosis."

    "question": "A 63-year-old woman presents with a six-month history of recurrent, painful, purpuric plaques on her lower extremities. The lesions occasionally ulcerate and slowly heal, leaving behind white, atrophic scars. She reports associated burning pain but no fever or joint symptoms. Past medical history is significant for poorly controlled diabetes and chronic kidney disease. Physical examination reveals livedoid reticularis on the lower legs with several stellate ulcers and patchy, porcelain-white scars on the ankles and feet. Laboratory investigation shows normal inflammatory markers, negative ANCA, and no evidence of cryoglobulinemia. A biopsy of an ulcerated area demonstrates hyalinized thrombi within small dermal blood vessels and marked epidermal atrophy, with minimal inflammation. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Livedoid vasculopathy (atrophie blanche)",
      "Pyoderma gangrenosum",
      "Leukocytoclastic vasculitis",
      "Erythema elevatum diutinum",
      "Calciphylaxis"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Livedoid vasculopathy, also known as atrophie blanche, typically presents in middle-aged patients with painful, recurrent purpuric plaques or ulcers on the lower extremities, leaving atrophic white scars ('atrophie blanche'). Risk factors include prothrombotic states (e.g., diabetes, kidney disease). Histology reveals thrombi in small vessels with little or no vasculitis. Findings such as livedo, porcelain-white scars, and hyalinized vessel thrombi point toward livedoid vasculopathy. Pyoderma gangrenosum and leukocytoclastic vasculitis are more inflammatory, calciphylaxis presents with necrotic plaques in the context of end-stage renal disease, and erythema elevatum diutinum manifests as firm red plaques/nodules, usually not ulcerating with atrophic scars."

    "question": "A 68-year-old male with a history of renal transplantation presents to the dermatology clinic with several rough, scaly lesions on the dorsum of his hands and forehead. He reports spending many years working outdoors as a construction worker. On exam, you note multiple erythematous, flat macules and papules with a rough texture, and one conical, keratotic protuberance on his right temple. Which of the following best explains the underlying pathogenesis of his most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "A. Accumulation of porphyrins causing photosensitivity and chronic skin changes",
      "B. Formation of thymidine dimers leading to p53 mutations in epidermal keratinocytes",
      "C. Infection with human papillomavirus resulting in uncontrolled keratinocyte proliferation",
      "D. Prolonged corticosteroid use causing epidermal thinning and atrophy",
      "E. Mutation in the filaggrin gene causing defective epidermal barrier function"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient shows classic clinical features of actinic keratosis (AK), especially a cutaneous horn on a background of sun-exposed, rough macules and papules in an immunosuppressed individual with significant cumulative sun exposure. The underlying pathogenesis involves ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation inducing thymidine dimer formation in DNA, leading to mutations in the tumor suppressor gene p53 within keratinocytes. This impairs apoptosis and promotes the clonal expansion of mutated cells, resulting in AK. The other options do not describe the molecular basis seen in AK."

    "question": "A 29-year-old man who recently immigrated from Brazil presents with multiple, symmetrical, poorly-defined, hypopigmented plaques and nodules on his upper limbs and face. The facial lesions include thickening of the skin and loss of eyebrows. He reports numbness over the lesions and has noticed swelling and tenderness in both hands over the past two weeks. On examination, there is loss of sensation over the plaques, thickened ulnar nerves, and several small, firm nodules on both earlobes. Punch biopsy of a facial nodule shows perivascular and diffuse lymphohistiocytic infiltration throughout the dermis with a clear grenz zone underlying the epidermis. Numerous foamy macrophages filled with globi of acid-fast bacilli are seen on Fite stain. Which of the following is the best explanation for the patient's acute hand swelling?",
    "choices": [
      "Development of reversal (Type 1) reaction due to increased cellular immunity against M. leprae",
      "Onset of Lucio\u2019s phenomenon associated with massive organism load and vascular thrombosis",
      "Immune complex\u2013mediated vasculitis (Type 2, erythema nodosum leprosum) secondary to lepromatous leprosy",
      "Superinfection with Staphylococcus aureus causing bullous impetigo",
      "Progression to tuberculoid leprosy characterized by paucibacillary lesions and epithelioid granulomas"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The patient has lepromatous leprosy, suggested by symmetrical lesions, loss of sensation, nerve enlargement, and foamy macrophages with globi of bacilli (Fite-positive). Acute swelling and tenderness of the hands in this context most likely represent Type 2 lepra reaction, known as erythema nodosum leprosum (ENL), an immune complex\u2013mediated vasculitis that can occur in patients with multibacillary leprosy (lepromatous/borderline lepromatous types). ENL causes systemic symptoms, including painful nodules and edema. Type 1 reactions (reversal) are typically characterized by increased cell-mediated immunity and affect borderline patients, while Lucio\u2019s phenomenon is rare, seen in untreated diffuse lepromatous leprosy, characterized by vascular thrombosis and necrosis, not acute hand edema. Paucibacillary (tuberculoid) disease would have few organisms and granulomas, not globi of bacilli. Staphylococcal superinfection and bullous impetigo would not fit the systemic and neuropathic findings."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with a slowly enlarging, firm, flesh-colored plaque on his right forearm at the site of an old tattoo. The lesion has gradually thickened over several months but is not painful or pruritic. The patient has no significant past medical history. Skin biopsy reveals granulomatous inflammation composed of tight, well-formed noncaseating granulomas scattered in the dermis, with minimal surrounding lymphoplasmacytic infiltrate. Polarized light examination identifies refractile, foreign material within some granulomas. Ziehl-Neelsen and periodic acid\u2013Schiff stains are negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cutaneous sarcoidosis",
      "Foreign body granuloma",
      "Cutaneous tuberculosis",
      "Cutaneous leishmaniasis",
      "Granulomatous rosacea"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes granulomatous inflammation at a site of trauma with noncaseating granulomas and foreign material identified under polarized light, classic for foreign body granuloma. While cutaneous sarcoidosis also shows noncaseating granulomas, the presence of foreign material is diagnostic for foreign body granuloma. Cutaneous tuberculosis typically shows caseation and more prominent lymphoplasmacytic inflammation. Cutaneous leishmaniasis and granulomatous rosacea would show other distinct histologic and clinical features not described here."

    "question": "A 17-year-old male presents to clinic with easy bruising, frequent nosebleeds, and a history of two spontaneous shoulder dislocations. On physical examination, he has hyperextensible skin, atrophic scars over his knees and elbows, and marked joint hypermobility. He mentions that his younger brother lost several teeth early due to severe gum disease. Laboratory review is unremarkable except for iron deficiency anemia. Which genetic abnormality is most likely responsible for the combination of symptoms seen in this patient and his brother?",
    "choices": [
      "COL5A1 or COL5A2 gene mutation (classic type EDS)",
      "Defect in lysyl hydroxylase gene (kyphoscoliotic EDS)",
      "Defect in type III collagen (vascular EDS)",
      "Defect in type I collagen (osteogenesis imperfecta)",
      "Defect in type IX collagen affecting periodontium (periodontitis type EDS)"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "The vignette highlights features of Ehlers-Danlos syndrome (EDS) with joint hypermobility, skin findings, and atrophic scars. The critical clue is the mention of the patient's brother suffering severe early-onset periodontitis with tooth loss, consistent with Type 8 EDS (periodontitis type) related to a defect in type IX collagen. The uniquely severe periodontal disease distinguishes this variant from other EDS types, which may have some overlap in joint and skin features but typically do not present with profound periodontal involvement."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents for repair of a 1.5cm full-thickness defect on the upper helix of the left ear following Mohs micrographic surgery for basal cell carcinoma. The surrounding tissue is under moderate tension. During wound closure, you wish to minimize tension, avoid dog-ear deformities, and optimize cosmetic outcome. In addition to removal of standing cones, absorbable buried sutures are placed in the deep dermis, and attention is given to apposition of the skin edges. Which of the following suturing techniques would most effectively minimize tension on the wound edges and assist with hemostasis in this scenario?",
    "choices": [
      "Simple interrupted sutures",
      "Running unlocked suture",
      "Vertical mattress suture",
      "Horizontal mattress suture",
      "Running subcuticular suture"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Among the listed choices, the horizontal mattress suture is most effective at reducing tension on wound edges and also assists in hemostasis. This is particularly important in areas under moderate tension like the ear, where tight approximation without excessive tension or dog-ears is desired. Vertical mattress sutures are better for eversion and for closing dead space, but horizontal mattress sutures specifically function to relieve tension from the wound margins and aid in achieving hemostasis, aligning closely with the scenario described."

He has a history of urticaria pigmentosa diagnosed in childhood. On examination, he is hypotensive, tachycardic, and has diffuse erythematous wheals. Which of the following is the most appropriate immediate management?",
    "choices": [
      "Oral cetirizine and topical corticosteroids",
      "Subcutaneous epinephrine",
      "Oral ketotifen fumarate and observation",
      "Methoxsalen plus PUVA therapy",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This patient is in vascular collapse (anaphylaxis) in the setting of cutaneous mastocytosis (urticaria pigmentosa). The reference states that epinephrine should be administered for vascular collapse, and patients should be trained to self-administer. Subcutaneous (or intramuscular) epinephrine is life-saving and should be administered immediately. Other options (antihistamines, ketotifen, PUVA, imatinib) are important for chronic management but are not appropriate in the acute, life-threatening setting of anaphylaxis."

    "question": "A 7-month-old infant is brought to clinic for evaluation of a persistent rash and poor weight gain. The child was born at term without complications, and was exclusively breastfed until being transitioned to formula at 5 months. Since then, the parents have noticed the development of crusted, erythematous plaques with vesicles and some bullae around the mouth, perineal region, and on the distal extremities. The infant is irritable, with occasional diarrhea. On examination, the infant has thin hair and evidence of paronychia. Laboratory investigation shows low serum alkaline phosphatase. There is no family history of similar complaints. Which of the following is the most likely underlying cause for this presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Iron deficiency due to inadequate dietary intake after weaning",
      "An autosomal recessive defect in a zinc-specific intestinal transporter",
      "Seborrheic dermatitis with secondary bacterial infection",
      "Primary immunodeficiency leading to chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis",
      "Deficiency of essential fatty acids"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The most likely diagnosis is acrodermatitis enteropathica, which is caused by an autosomal recessive defect in the SLC39A4 gene encoding a zinc transporter. This defect manifests after weaning from breast milk, as breast milk's zinc is more bioavailable than formula. The characteristic rash with vesicles/bullae on periorificial and acral areas, alopecia, diarrhea, and low alkaline phosphatase are classic for zinc deficiency due to this genetic defect. The other options do not explain this constellation of findings."

    "question": "A 65-year-old man with a history of hypertension presents for removal of a 6-mm raised, bleeding nodule on the right cheek. The dermatologist decides to excise the lesion using an electrical device. During the procedure, the physician selects a setting that allows precise cutting with minimal lateral thermal damage and minimal coagulation of surrounding tissue. On histological review, the excised margins show a sharp incision approximately 0.1 mm wide, with minimal coagulative change in adjacent cells. Given this scenario, which electrosurgical modality was MOST likely used?",
    "choices": [
      "Monopolar noterminal technique",
      "Electrocoagulation",
      "Electrosection with coagulation",
      "Pure electrosection",
      "Electrocautery"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Pure electrosection is performed using a biterminal device and low voltage, producing cell disintegration that results in a sharp incision roughly 0.1 mm in width, with minimal adjacent coagulation. Unlike electrocoagulation or electrosection with coagulation, pure electrosection causes precise cutting with little lateral thermal damage and almost no coagulative effect, which matches the histological findings in this scenario. Noterminal (monopolar) technique is not an electrosurgical modality described here, and electrocautery produces amorphous charred tissue with steam spaces, not the observed precise incision."

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy presents to the clinic after experiencing sudden, intense burning pain on his forearm, which developed while playing in his backyard. Within minutes, he noticed localized redness, swelling, and the appearance of urticarial wheals at the site, followed by the development of vesicles. He recalls brushing against a 'fuzzy' caterpillar with brown and orange coloration. His past medical history is unremarkable. On examination, there is a linear erythematous, edematous plaque with vesicles but no necrosis, and no systemic symptoms are present. Which animal is most likely responsible for this clinical presentation?",
    "choices": [
      "Gypsy moth caterpillar (Lymantria dispar)",
      "Giant silkworm moth caterpillar (Lonomia obliqua)",
      "Saddleback caterpillar (Acharia stimulea)",
      "Puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis)",
      "Black widow spider (Latrodectus mactans)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "The clinical features\u2014intense burning pain, urticarial and vesicular eruption after contact with a 'fuzzy' caterpillar\u2014are classic for envenomation by the puss caterpillar (Megalopyge opercularis). This species is notorious for severe localized reactions due to its venomous spines. The gypsy moth caterpillar and saddleback caterpillar can also cause reactions but are generally less severe. The giant silkworm moth caterpillar is associated with more severe systemic effects, including coagulopathy. Black widow spider bites typically present with muscle cramping and systemic manifestations rather than localized urticarial plaques and vesicles after contact with a caterpillar-like animal."

He reports that several family members and coworkers also developed similar symptoms over the past few weeks. He has tried various over-the-counter antihistamines without relief. On examination, there are numerous excoriated papules with burrows visible between the fingers and on the wrists. What is the most appropriate first-line topical treatment for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Lindane lotion",

      "Posaconazole oral solution",
      "Amphotericin B IV"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario is most consistent with classic scabies, given the presence of intensely pruritic papules, burrows, and household contacts. The first-line topical treatment is permethrin cream, a synthetic pyrethroid with low toxicity and high efficacy for scabies. Lindane is less favored due to neurotoxicity risk, especially in children and pregnant women. Griseofulvin, posaconazole, and amphotericin B are antifungal agents, and are not indicated for scabies."

No burrows or excoriations are found on the interdigital spaces. Several family members have similar but milder symptoms after the trip. Which of the following is the most likely causative organism?",
    "choices": [
      "Sarcoptes scabiei",
      "Trombiculid mite larva (chigger)",
      "Dermatophyte fungus",
      "Pediculus humanus corporis",

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes intensely pruritic papules and urticarial plaques occurring during camping, with distribution at areas of tight-fitting clothing\u2014classic for chigger (trombiculid mite larva) bites. Scabies (Sarcoptes scabiei) typically affects interdigital spaces and is associated with burrows. Dermatophyte infection does not present with sudden-onset urticarial papules. Pediculosis corporis causes pruritus and excoriations in seams of clothing but not urticarial papules with central vesiculation. Ixodes ticks may transmit Lyme disease but do not cause grouped pruritic papules. The correct answer is Trombiculid mite larva (chigger)."

He reports frequent sun exposure and minimal use of sun protection. He has a history of long-term immunosuppressive therapy. A biopsy from one of the lesions reveals a squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Which of the following best explains the increased risk of skin cancer in this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Enhanced Langerhans cell migration due to UV exposure",
      "Augmented delayed-type hypersensitivity response from sunburn",
      "UV-induced reduction in antigen-presenting cell numbers and function, compromising immune surveillance",
      "Expansion of memory T-cells that promote tumor immunity",
      "Increased circulating natural killer (NK) cell activity after UV exposure"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Ultraviolet (UV) radiation reduces the number and function of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) in the skin, particularly Langerhans cells, leading to impaired immune surveillance. This effect is compounded in immunosuppressed patients, such as organ transplant recipients, thereby increasing their risk of skin cancers including squamous cell carcinoma. The depressed ability to prime an immune response in these patients, especially following UV exposure, is a key factor in the development of malignancies."

On examination, there is a solitary, firm, erythematous nodule measuring 2.3 cm with a smooth surface and no ulceration. The patient denies any recent trauma or insect exposure. Dermoscopy reveals arborizing vessels, and a punch biopsy demonstrates atypical clear cells in the dermis with a nested growth pattern; immunohistochemistry is positive for cytokeratin and CD10. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical history of rapid growth, the patient's past history of renal cell carcinoma, and the biopsy showing clear cells with markers (cytokeratin and CD10 positivity) point strongly to cutaneous metastasis from renal cell carcinoma. Renal cell carcinoma is known for clear cell morphology and can rarely metastasize to the skin, often presenting as a rapidly enlarging nodule. This matches the section on metastatic tumors to the skin (pages 397\u2013398) in the reference material.

Laboratory studies reveal pancytopenia and mildly elevated liver enzymes. A skin biopsy demonstrates a diffuse infiltrate of histiocytes throughout the subcutis, with prominent macrophages containing erythrocytes and nuclear debris (bean bag cells).

Physical exam reveals multiple polymorphic papules, some pustular and violaceous, scattered over the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs, as well as the trunk, with areas of atrophic scarring. Dermoscopy shows monomorphic, perifollicular, round dots with central black plugs and peripheral scaling and hyperpigmentation. HIV testing is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Lichen scrofulosorum",
      "Papulonecrotic tuberculid",
      "Erythema induratum of Bazin",
      "Chronic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)",
      "Prurigo nodularis"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The key clinical features are recurring crops of painless, polymorphic papules, some pustular or nodular, which heal with varioliform scarring, primarily on the extremities and trunk. This pattern, along with patient's background and negative HIV status, is classic for papulonecrotic tuberculid, which is a hypersensitivity reaction to Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Dermoscopic findings\u2014monomorphic, perifollicular dots with black plugs and scaling\u2014are more characteristic of lichen scrofulosorum, but that condition does not heal with scarring or such polymorphism of lesions. Erythema induratum tends to present as tender nodules that ulcerate, typically on the posterior calves (not described here). Chronic GVHD usually involves different morphology and mucous membranes. Prurigo nodularis is characterized by intensely pruritic nodular lesions, which is not described in this scenario."

    "question": "A 67-year-old man presents with a several-month history of slowly enlarging erythematous plaques and nodules on his trunk and arms. The lesions are non-tender and do not ulcerate. He feels well, denies fevers or weight loss, and physical examination reveals no lymphadenopathy or hepatosplenomegaly. A punch biopsy of a lesion demonstrates a dense dermal infiltrate of atypical lymphoid cells with centrocyte and centroblast morphology, forming follicular and diffuse patterns. Immunohistochemistry is positive for CD20, BCL6, and negative for BCL2 and MUM1. Bone marrow biopsy and PET-CT are negative for systemic disease. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Primary cutaneous marginal zone lymphoma (PC-MZL)",
      "Primary cutaneous follicle center cell lymphoma (PC-FCL)",
      "Cutaneous involvement by chronic lymphocytic leukemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL)",
      "Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) of the skin",
      "Intravascular large B cell lymphoma"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a patient with indolent erythematous plaques and nodules, without systemic symptoms or extracutaneous disease, and histopathology showing follicle center cell (centrocyte and centroblast) infiltrates in the skin. Immunophenotype is CD20+, BCL6+, but negative for BCL2 and MUM1, which is typical for primary cutaneous follicle center cell lymphoma (PC-FCL). PC-FCL commonly presents on the trunk or head and neck, has a slow course, and typically is negative for BCL2 (unlike nodal follicular lymphoma) and MUM1 (which marks more aggressive forms or DLBCL). The other choices are less likely based on clinical presentation and immunophenotype."

    "question": "A 53-year-old woman presents with a two-week history of fever, malaise, and a sudden eruption of hundreds of small, non-follicular pustules on a background of erythema, mainly affecting her face, trunk, and intertriginous areas. She recently started taking amoxicillin-clavulanic acid for a sinus infection. Laboratory investigations reveal leukocytosis and mild liver enzyme elevation. She denies joint pain or pre-existing psoriasis. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis (AGEP)",
      "Pustular psoriasis",
      "Drug-induced lupus erythematosus",
      "Stevens-Johnson syndrome",
      "Erythema multiforme major"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "AGEP is characterized by the acute onset of diffuse, sterile, non-follicular pustules on erythematous skin, usually triggered by medications (most commonly antibiotics like beta-lactams). It is associated with fever, leukocytosis, and sometimes mild organ involvement. The rapid appearance, typical drug exposure, absence of a psoriasis history, and distribution all support AGEP over other options. Pustular psoriasis tends to have a personal or family history, more prominent systemic involvement, and different triggers. Stevens-Johnson syndrome and erythema multiforme present with more significant mucosal involvement and targetoid lesions, not pustules. Drug-induced lupus rarely presents in this manner."

    "question": "A 5-year-old child of African descent presents to your dermatology clinic for evaluation of light skin patches and hypopigmented hair since birth. Her parents note that she burns easily in the sun but the severity is less than expected given her complexion. She has nystagmus and moderate visual impairment, but some tanning of the skin has developed over the last few years. Physical exam reveals light brown hair and several areas of freckles. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Oculocutaneous albinism type 1A (OCA1A)",
      "Oculocutaneous albinism type 2 (OCA2)",
      "Oculocutaneous albinism type 3 (OCA3)",
      "Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome",
      "Chediak-Higashi syndrome"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "OCA2 is the most common form of OCA and often affects individuals of African descent. Patients typically have minimal pigment at birth, but skin and hair darken over time, sometimes developing a 'brown OCA' phenotype with light brown hair and fewer sunburns than expected. Nystagmus and moderate visual impairment are common. OCA1A features an absolute lack of pigment and no tanning. OCA3 is characterized by 'rufous' pigmentation, especially in African populations, but with generally red-toned skin and hair. Hermansky-Pudlak and Chediak-Higashi syndromes are much rarer and have additional systemic features."

    "question": "A 3-year-old child from a low-resource setting presents with generalized swelling, a distended abdomen, and peeling skin described by the mother as 'flaky paint.' Physical examination reveals lower extremity edema, sparse, hypopigmented hair with alternating bands of pigmentation, and several superficial skin infections. The child appears well-nourished in terms of body fat reserves but is irritable and apathetic. Which nutritional deficiency most likely explains this constellation of symptoms?",
    "choices": [
      "Vitamin A deficiency",
      "Vitamin C deficiency",
      "Protein deficiency with adequate calorie intake (Kwashiorkor)",
      "Total calorie and protein deficiency (Marasmus)",
      "High intake of red fruits and vegetables (Lycopenemia)"

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This child's presentation of edema/anasarca, pot belly, 'flaky paint' desquamation of the skin, light and dark bands in the hair ('flag sign'), and superimposed infections is characteristic of kwashiorkor. Kwashiorkor results from protein deficiency in the setting of adequate caloric intake, distinguishing it from marasmus (which features severe wasting without edema). Vitamin A and C deficiencies have different cutaneous manifestations, and lycopenemia causes only skin discoloration without systemic signs."

    "question": "A 9-year-old boy is brought to the dermatologist with widespread blistering and erosions on areas of trauma, including the hands, feet, and oral mucosa. His parents report that blisters develop with minimal friction, and he has had these symptoms since infancy. On examination, there are atrophic scars, milia, and nail dystrophy on the digits. A skin biopsy reveals subepidermal blister formation, and direct immunofluorescence is negative for antibodies. Genetic analysis demonstrates a mutation in the gene encoding type VII collagen. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex",
      "Junctional Epidermolysis Bullosa",
      "Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa",
      "Bullous Congenital Ichthyosiform Erythroderma",
      "Pemphigus Vulgaris"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (DEB) is characterized by mutations in the gene encoding type VII collagen, which anchors the epidermis to the dermis. This results in subepidermal blistering, atrophic scarring, milia, and nail dystrophy, classically presenting with blisters at trauma-prone sites from early childhood. Epidermolysis Bullosa Simplex involves blisters within the basal layer; Junctional EB involves blisters at the level of the lamina lucida with different gene mutations. Bullous Congenital Ichthyosiform Erythroderma has a different presentation with generalized erythroderma and scaling, and Pemphigus Vulgaris is an autoimmune intraepidermal disease, typically in adults, not children."

    "question": "A 24-year-old woman with moderate inflammatory acne vulgaris is started on oral minocycline by her dermatologist. Six months into therapy, she notices asymptomatic blue-black discoloration of her shins and gray-green staining of her teeth. She has no significant medical history and takes no other medications. Laboratory investigations are unremarkable except for mild liver enzyme elevation. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the patient's complications?",
    "choices": [
      "Minocycline-induced pigmentation is most likely to affect mucous membranes and cannot affect the nails.",
      "Permanent tooth discoloration from minocycline typically appears as a yellow hue limited to the incisal edges of teeth.",
      "Minocycline-induced pigmentation may also affect existing scars and sclerae and is distinct from phototoxic reactions seen with doxycycline.",
      "These pigmentary changes are always reversible on discontinuing the drug.",
      "Doxycycline is contraindicated in children due to risk of dental staining."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Minocycline can cause blue-black pigmentation of the skin (especially the shins), nails, existing scars, and sclerae, and produces a gray-green discoloration of the permanent teeth in adults, often involving the midportion. This is distinct from doxycycline, which carries a risk of phototoxicity but recent evidence suggests it does not cause dental staining in children. The pigmentary changes from minocycline may not be reversible even with drug cessation. Mucous membranes are less commonly affected and tooth discoloration is not limited to incisal edges nor is it yellow. Doxycycline may be used in children, contrary to old beliefs."

    "question": "A 57-year-old man of Mediterranean descent presents with multiple violaceous plaques and nodules on his lower extremities. He has no known history of immunosuppression. He denies constitutional symptoms and has no lymphadenopathy. Biopsy reveals proliferating spindle-shaped cells with slit-like vascular spaces and extravasated red blood cells. Which of the following is the most likely underlying factor responsible for the development of his condition?",
    "choices": [
      "Infection with human papillomavirus (HPV)",
      "Mutations in the BRAF gene",
      "Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) infection",
      "Exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation",
      "Use of systemic corticosteroids"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The presentation is most consistent with classic Kaposi's Sarcoma (KS), which typically affects men of Ashkenazi Jewish or Mediterranean descent. HHV-8 (Human herpesvirus 8) infection is the implicated agent in all clinical variants of KS, regardless of immune status. HPV is associated with warts and anogenital neoplasms, BRAF mutations with melanoma, UV radiation with a variety of skin cancers (especially basal and squamous cell carcinoma), and corticosteroids with iatrogenic immunosuppressed KS, but not the classic variant seen here."

    "question": "A 28-year-old woman presents to your dermatology clinic with a 3-month history of patchy hair loss on her scalp. She reports no itching or pain. On examination, there is a well-demarcated, round, smooth patch of complete hair loss over the right parietal area. The surrounding skin is normal and there is no erythema or scaling. A gentle hair pull on the periphery yields several small, \u2018exclamation mark\u2019 hairs. She denies pulling at her hair and has no psychiatric history. Her nails are normal. There is no other body hair loss. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Trichotillomania",
      "Alopecia areata",
      "Tinea capitis",
      "Chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus (discoid lupus)",
      "Telogen effluvium"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The patient presents with a single smooth, round, well-demarcated patch of non-scarring alopecia, absent inflammation, scaling, or broken-off hairs. The presence of \u2018exclamation mark\u2019 hairs at the margin is pathognomonic for alopecia areata. Trichotillomania causes irregular patches with broken hairs of varying length, usually with evidence of hair pulling or psychiatric symptoms. Tinea capitis is inflammatory, scaling, and often with lymphadenopathy. Discoid lupus presents with scarring alopecia accompanied by erythema and atrophy. Telogen effluvium presents as diffuse, not patchy, hair loss."

    "question": "A 35-year-old woman with a history of ulcerative colitis presents with new-onset rapidly enlarging, painful ulcers on her legs. The lesions began as tender papulopustules with surrounding erythema, then developed into deep ulcers with violaceous, undermined borders. She reports previous episodes where minor trauma led to worsening of the ulcers. Laboratory workup is notable for leukocytosis, and infectious workup is negative. Which additional finding would most strongly support the diagnosis, and what is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Neutrophilic infiltrates on skin biopsy; initiate high-dose systemic corticosteroids.",
      "Granulomatous inflammation with caseating necrosis; start anti-tuberculous therapy.",
      "Vasculitis with eosinophilic infiltrate; prescribe dapsone.",
      "Lobular panniculitis with granuloma formation; initiate colchicine.",
      "Perivascular lymphocytic infiltrate; begin topical antibiotics."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "The clinical features described\u2014rapidly enlarging painful ulcers with undermined violaceous borders in a patient with ulcerative colitis\u2014are classic for pyoderma gangrenosum. Skin biopsy often shows a sterile neutrophilic infiltrate (not specific but supportive), and the mainstay of treatment is systemic immunosuppression, most often with high-dose corticosteroids. Granulomas with caseating necrosis suggest tuberculosis, panniculitis with granulomas suggests erythema nodosum, and eosinophilic infiltrate implies a drug reaction or Churg-Strauss. Topical antibiotics play no role in this immune-mediated dermatosis."

    "question": "A 34-year-old man presents to the dermatology clinic for evaluation of a 7mm asymmetric, irregularly pigmented macule on his upper back. Dermoscopy reveals lack of organization, pigment variation, and architectural disorder. Excisional biopsy shows nests of atypical melanocytes at the basal epidermis, extension of the junctional component more than 3 rete ridges beyond the dermal component, and no evidence of dermal invasion. Margins of excision are clear. What is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Re-excision with wider margins to ensure complete removal",
      "Observation with no further surgical intervention",
      "Immediate referral to oncology for sentinel lymph node biopsy",
      "Initiate topical Imiquimod cream to reduce recurrence",
      "Begin systemic immunotherapy with pembrolizumab"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histologic scenario is most consistent with a dysplastic nevus (DN) with clear margins. According to recent consensus recommendations, mildly or moderately dysplastic nevi that are completely excised with clear margins do not require further re-excision. Observation is appropriate. Further surgical or systemic intervention is not indicated unless there is evidence of melanoma or residual lesion."

He is otherwise healthy. Biopsy reveals a dense, dermal infiltrate composed of sheets of markedly atypical, enlarged lymphoid cells. Immunostaining reveals that over 80% of the infiltrating cells are positive for CD30, but negative for EMA and ALK. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Cutaneous lymphomatoid papulosis (LyP), type C",
      "Mycosis fungoides with large cell transformation",
      "Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL)",
      "Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type",
      "Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma, cutaneous involvement"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Primary cutaneous anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (PC-ALCL) presents with localized lesions (as opposed to the recurrent, self-resolving crops of LyP) and histologically shows a dense dermal infiltrate of sheets of markedly atypical, CD30+ (>75% of the cells), EMA\u2013, and ALK\u2013 large cells. Differentiating features from LyP type C include the solitary or localized presentation and the lack of waxing and waning lesions. Mycosis fungoides with large cell transformation may be CD30+ but typically does not have the majority of cells expressing CD30 and often shows epidermotropism. Extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma would be unlikely without classical localization (nasal/midline structures) or presence of specific histopathology. Systemic ALCL is typically EMA+ and/or ALK+ and often has systemic disease."

Merkel cell carcinoma is negative for melanocyte markers such as S-100, HMB-45, and MITF, ruling out melanoma, blue nevus, and neurothekeoma. Dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans would show spindle cells positive for CD34."

She reports no other new skincare products, medications, or foods. On further questioning, she mentions using a broad-spectrum chemical sunscreen containing benzophenone derivatives. Patch testing is negative, but photopatch testing reveals a marked reaction to her sunscreen. What is the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    "choices": [
      "Advise switching to a sunscreen with only titanium dioxide and zinc oxide",
      "Suggest adding topical corticosteroids before sun exposure",
      "Reassure and recommend continued use of her current sunscreen due to its broad UV protection",

      "Advise using a sunscreen with higher UVB protection, such as those containing PABA or octyl methoxycinnamate"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient's reaction following sun exposure, but not to patch testing, with a positive photopatch test to benzophenone indicates photoallergic reaction to benzophenone-based chemical sunscreens. There are increasing reports of photoallergy to benzophenones, which are broad-spectrum chemical UV filters, especially for UVA/UVB. The best management is to switch to a physical sunscreen containing titanium dioxide and zinc oxide, which provide protection without risk of photoallergic reactions."

    "question": "A 12-year-old boy from a rural area in Central America is brought to the clinic because of skin lesions on his legs. Initially, he developed a painless papule on his shin, which ulcerated but healed over several weeks without treatment. Over the last several months, multiple smaller papular lesions have developed on his legs and arms. He reports mild itching but no pain, fever, or systemic symptoms. On examination, there are several hyperkeratotic, scaly papules clustered on the lower limbs and forearms, along with a depigmented patch over the shin. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

      "Pinta",
      "Leprosy",
      "Cutaneous leishmaniasis"

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes the classic evolution of yaws: a painless 'mother yaw' papule that ulcerates and heals, followed by secondary 'daughter yaws' (smaller lesions in a broader distribution), and ultimately depigmented patches in tertiary disease. Yaws is endemic in Central/South America, caused by Treponema pallidum pertenue. Pinta also causes depigmented lesions but typically begins as primary macules that enlarge into plaques and 'pintids' before vitiligo-like changes; vitiligo, leprosy, and leishmaniasis present differently."

The main autoantigen is BPAg2-NC16A. Options such as Desmoglein 1 and 3 are relevant to pemphigus, BPAg1 is more associated with bullous pemphigoid, portions of BPAg2 distinct from NC16A are linked with linear IgA disease, and type VII collagen is associated with epidermolysis bullosa acquisita."

He recalls handling some imported animal hides the week prior. On examination, there is a 2-cm necrotic ulcer with surrounding edema and several non-tender vesicles. The patient is otherwise systemically well. Which of the following best describes the pathogenesis of his cutaneous findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Exotoxin-mediated destruction by Streptococcus pyogenes superantigens",

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The scenario describes classic cutaneous anthrax following contact with animal products. Bacillus anthracis produces edema factor (EF), a calmodulin-dependent adenylate cyclase, and protective antigen (PA); their combination forms edema toxin, which increases cAMP and leads to pronounced tissue edema. This pathogenesis is specific to anthrax and distinguishes it from other infectious etiologies with skin necrosis. Antibiotic treatment does not alter the skin lesion\u2019s course due to established toxin-mediated tissue damage."

On examination, the lesion is 6 mm, symmetric, and has a flat, tan portion with a central, slightly raised, pinkish, smooth nodule. Dermoscopy shows a combination of network and globular patterns. A biopsy demonstrates a well-circumscribed, predominantly intradermal melanocytic proliferation composed of two distinct cell populations: one conventional round nevus cell type and a second population of large epithelioid cells with abundant cytoplasm and conspicuous nucleoli. Immunohistochemistry reveals loss of nuclear BAP1 expression specifically in the epithelioid cells, and molecular testing reveals a BRAF V600E mutation. What is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [

    "explanation": "The scenario describes a lesion with two cell populations: conventional nevus cells and a second population of large epithelioid ('spitzoid') cells that have lost nuclear BAP1 expression and harbor a BRAF V600E mutation. This combination is characteristic of a BAP1-inactivated melanocytic tumor (BAPoma), which is a combined nevus. Spitz nevi may have spitzoid features but do not have loss of BAP1 or this combination of genetic alterations. Blue nevus, special site nevus, and deep penetrating nevus have distinct clinical and histologic characteristics that do not match this presentation."

    "explanation": "The scenario describes erythema elevatum diutinum (EED), a chronic form of cutaneous vasculitis typically involving extensor surfaces, with lesions that are often symmetric and related to underlying hematologic abnormalities (such as IgA paraproteinemia). Histology shows leukocytoclastic vasculitis and fibrosis. The chronicity, localization, and association with paraproteinemia point to EED rather than general leukocytoclastic vasculitis or other vasculitic disorders. Nodular vasculitis usually involves panniculitis and affects the lower legs. Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura involves palpable purpura, commonly in children, and is associated with abdominal and renal symptoms.

First-line therapy consists of topical antifungal agents such as selenium sulfide shampoo or ketoconazole cream. Oral regimens (see reference 5) are reserved for more extensive or recurrent cases, but long-term oral antifungals (such as daily fluconazole for 6 months) are not appropriate.

    "question": "A 52-year-old male presents with a 2-month history of tense, fluid-filled blisters and erosions on his abdomen and inner thighs. He complains of intense pruritus but denies any mucosal involvement. His past medical history is significant for hypertension, controlled with medication. On examination, there are multiple large, tense bullae on an erythematous base, with scattered areas of urticarial plaques, but no oral or genital lesions. A skin biopsy from the edge of a fresh blister reveals a subepidermal separation with prominent infiltration of eosinophils in the underlying dermis. Direct immunofluorescence demonstrates linear deposition of IgG and C3 along the basement membrane zone. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Pemphigus vulgaris",
      "Bullous pemphigoid",
      "Dermatitis herpetiformis",
      "Linear IgA bullous dermatosis",
      "Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histopathological features point towards bullous pemphigoid: older age, tense bullae, absence of mucosal involvement, subepidermal blister with eosinophils, and linear IgG and C3 deposition at the basement membrane. Pemphigus vulgaris typically involves flaccid intraepidermal blisters and mucosal involvement. Dermatitis herpetiformis presents with grouped vesicles and neutrophilic microabscesses at the dermal papillae. Linear IgA bullous dermatosis shows linear IgA deposition, not IgG or C3. Epidermolysis bullosa acquisita often has less inflammation and more trauma-induced lesions."

    "question": "A 68-year-old HIV-negative man with a long-standing history of lower leg chronic venous stasis presents with multiple violaceous plaques over both lower extremities. He reports no systemic symptoms. On exam, the plaques are firm, non-tender, and poorly demarcated, with areas of hemosiderin staining. A skin biopsy shows proliferation of thick-walled dermal blood vessels, marked erythrocyte extravasation, and prominent hemosiderin deposition. Endothelial cells are bland and there is no significant mitotic activity. Immunohistochemistry for HHV-8 is negative. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Acroangiodermatitis (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma)",
      "Kaposi sarcoma",
      "Angiosarcoma",
      "Bacillary angiomatosis",
      "Stasis dermatitis"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This case describes features of acroangiodermatitis (pseudo-Kaposi's sarcoma), which occurs in the setting of chronic venous hypertension and stasis. Pathology shows proliferation of thickened vessels and hemosiderin deposition, with bland endothelial cells and no HHV-8. Kaposi sarcoma also presents as violaceous plaques, but would show HHV-8 positivity, more pronounced spindle cell proliferation, and slit-like vascular spaces. Angiosarcoma would have cytologic atypia and a more aggressive clinical course. Bacillary angiomatosis generally occurs in immunocompromised hosts and has neutrophilic infiltrate with bacilli seen on Warthin-Starry stain. Stasis dermatitis is more eczematous and less vascular on histology."

    "question": "A 54-year-old man presents with a slowly enlarging, non-ulcerated, firm nodule on his upper back. The lesion is excised; histology reveals a dermal-based, poorly circumscribed spindle cell proliferation with dense collagen deposition. The tumor cells are S-100 positive, SOX-10 positive, but negative for Melan-A/MART-1 and HMB-45. Which immunohistochemical interpretation best supports the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Desmoplastic melanoma, as SOX-10 is highly sensitive and specific for this diagnosis",
      "A cellular blue nevus, as S-100 positivity is highly specific for this entity",
      "Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor (MPNST), as SOX-10 and S-100 are sensitive and specific markers for neural tumors",
      "Desmoplastic melanoma, given SOX-10 is more sensitive than Melan-A/MART-1 and S-100 positivity supports a neural crest origin",
      "Atypical fibroxanthoma, as S-100 and SOX-10 are sensitive for this diagnosis"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Desmoplastic melanoma often shows strong nuclear SOX-10 positivity and S-100 expression, but is frequently negative for melanocytic markers like Melan-A/MART-1 and HMB-45. SOX-10 is a more sensitive marker for desmoplastic melanoma than Melan-A/MART-1. However, neither SOX-10 nor S-100 is entirely specific, as both can also stain neural tumors. The combination of SOX-10 and S-100 positivity with the clinical and pathologic features is characteristic, making choice 4 correct."

    "question": "A 13-year-old girl presents with a three-month history of a firm, depressed, smooth, hyperpigmented linear plaque running from the mid-forehead to the bridge of her nose. The lesion is asymptomatic but has become more prominent, with subtle tightening of the overlying skin. On examination, there is fixation of the skin to the underlying tissues along the lesion, without involvement of her oral mucosa or digits. She denies Raynaud phenomenon, and review of systems is unremarkable. Laboratory workup shows a positive anti-single stranded DNA antibody. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Begin topical corticosteroids and monitor for progression.",
      "Refer for initiation of systemic immunosuppressive therapy including prednisone and methotrexate.",
      "Order nailfold capillaroscopy and screen for systemic sclerosis.",
      "Reassure the patient and arrange routine follow-up only.",
      "Request tissue biopsy to confirm diagnosis and defer treatment until histology."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes 'en coup de sabre', a form of linear scleroderma (linear morphea) presenting in a typical juvenile patient, with involvement of the frontal head and evidence of deep layer fixation. The presence of anti-ssDNA supports the diagnosis. Linear scleroderma is associated with risk of deeper tissue involvement and disfigurement. Urgent treatment with systemic immunosuppressives (prednisone and methotrexate) is indicated to limit progression and prevent complications. Topical therapy alone is inadequate for deep/extensive involvement. Routine monitoring, reassurance, or delaying treatment pending biopsy is inappropriate given the risk of morbidity. Screening for systemic sclerosis is not necessary in the absence of systemic findings or Raynaud's."

He presents with several weeks of developing tender, erythematous papules and nodules on his arms, many of which have ulcerated or bleed easily. He is otherwise healthy except for a history of fever and malaise that resolved prior to the appearance of the nodules. Laboratory tests are unremarkable and blood cultures are negative. Given the clinical course and epidemiological context, which of the following is the most appropriate initial treatment?",
    "choices": [
      "Doxycycline",
      "Azithromycin",
      "Chloramphenicol plus \u03b2-lactam",
      "Amoxicillin",

    "explanation": "The patient\u2019s presentation is consistent with verruga peruana (chronic phase of Carrion\u2019s disease) caused by Bartonella bacilliformis and transmitted by the sand fly Lutzomyia verrucarum. Azithromycin is the recommended treatment for verruga peruana. Chloramphenicol plus a \u03b2-lactam is used in the acute phase (Oroya fever) because of the risk of Salmonella superinfection. Quinolones may be used in children over 6 and nonpregnant adults but are not first-line. Doxycycline is the choice for Borrelia (Lyme disease), not Bartonella. Amoxicillin is used in Lyme disease for young children or pregnant women."

    "question": "A 62-year-old man with poorly controlled diabetes and recent chemotherapy for lymphoma presents to the emergency department with rapid onset of facial swelling, black necrotic eschar at the left nasal bridge, and fever. He is started on a systemic antifungal after imaging confirms invasive sinus involvement. Forty-eight hours later, his creatinine rises significantly, and potassium drops despite IV supplementation. He reports severe headaches and also develops new erythematous scaly patches on sun-exposed skin. Which of the following statements best explains these findings?",
    "choices": [
      "The antifungal agent often causes photoallergic reactions, induces cytochrome P-450, and requires monitoring for nephrotoxicity and hypokalemia.",
      "The antifungal agent is highly effective against candidiasis and Pityrosporum infections and rarely affects the kidneys or electrolytes.",
      "The medication blocks neural transmission in parasites but is not indicated for invasive sinus mycoses and has no impact on sun sensitivity or renal function.",
      "The drug acts via inhibition of cell wall synthesis and is associated with hyperkalemia rather than hypokalemia.",
      "The medication is safe in porphyric patients and does not exacerbate acute intermittent porphyria."
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This patient is being treated with an antifungal for mucormycosis, likely amphotericin B or (from the reference focus), griseofulvin. However, the reference points to griseofulvin, which is not effective for candidiasis or Pityrosporum, induces cytochrome P-450, causes nephrotoxicity with hypokalemia and hypomagnesemia, photoallergy (can cause lupus-like reactions and severe skin reactions), and is contraindicated in porphyria. The answer discusses the correct constellation of adverse effects and pharmacologic properties, in contrast to the incorrect distractors."

He developed facial pain and fever two days ago, and exam now reveals significant tenderness and numbness over the right maxillary area. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy has been ineffective. A skin biopsy from the lesion shows broad, non-septate hyphae invading blood vessels. Which of the following organisms is the most likely causative agent?",
    "choices": [
      "Aspergillus fumigatus",
      "Mucor species",
      "Cryptococcus neoformans",
      "Geotrichum candidum",

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes a classic case of rhino-orbital-cerebral mucormycosis, a rapidly invasive, often fatal, opportunistic infection most commonly seen in immunocompromised or diabetic patients. The hallmark clinical findings are necrotic black eschar and cranial nerve involvement due to vascular invasion. The histologic finding of broad, ribbon-like, non-septate hyphae is characteristic of Mucor species (Zygomycetes). Aspergillus has septate hyphae, Cryptococcus and Geotrichum do not have this invasive filamentous form, and Penicillium marneffei is uncommon and presents differently."

They are tender to palpation, especially when exposed to cold. He reports similar skin lesions in his father and paternal aunt. Family history is also notable for early-onset uterine cancer in his paternal aunt. Further review reveals no significant history of trauma or infection. On examination, there are multiple discrete papules, measuring 0.5\u20131 cm, distributed in a segmental pattern. Laboratory workup is unremarkable. Which of the following findings is this patient at greatest risk for, given his likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [

    "question": "A 55-year-old man with a history of poorly controlled HIV presents with multiple violaceous plaques and nodules on his lower extremities. Some lesions have coalesced into larger plaques, which are firm and extend into the subcutaneous fat. A biopsy of a nodular lesion reveals intersecting fascicles of spindle cells replacing dermal collagen, separated by slit-like spaces containing erythrocytes. What is the most specific histopathologic finding that helps distinguish this diagnosis from an angiosarcoma?",
    "choices": [
      "A. The presence of intersecting spindle cell fascicles with slit-like vascular spaces",
      "B. Frequent mitotic figures and marked cytologic atypia",
      "C. Proliferation of plump endothelial cells lining well-formed vascular channels",

      "E. Erythrocyte extravasation with mild perivascular inflammation"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "Kaposiform spindle-cell proliferation with slit-like vascular spaces and erythrocytes is characteristic of Kaposi sarcoma (KS), particularly in plaque and nodular stages. This feature distinguishes KS from angiosarcoma, which typically shows more pronounced nuclear atypia, frequent mitoses, and vascular spaces lined by markedly atypical endothelial cells. While infiltrative growth and erythrocyte extravasation may be seen in both but are less specific. The presence of intersecting spindle cell fascicles and slit-like vascular spaces is most characteristic for KS."

The overlying skin is normal in color. There is no ulceration or suppuration. He reports occasional arthralgia but feels otherwise well. Laboratory tests reveal normal ACE levels, negative ANA, and no evidence of infection. A skin biopsy shows well-formed, non-caseating granulomas composed of epithelioid histiocytes and occasional Langhans giant cells in the mid-dermis and subcutis, surrounded by a sparse lymphocytic infiltrate. Polarization microscopy is negative for foreign material. Which is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Necrobiosis lipoidica",
      "Sarcoidosis (nodular cutaneous type)",
      "Granuloma annulare",
      "Cutaneous tuberculosis (lupus vulgaris)",
      "Rheumatoid nodule"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histopathological features strongly favor sarcoidosis\u2014specifically, the nodular cutaneous (sarcoidal) type. Non-caseating granulomas with little lymphocytic inflammation ('naked granulomas'), normal ACE, and the absence of infectious or autoimmune markers (negative Fite, PAS, ANA) support this. Necrobiosis lipoidica usually occurs on the shins with layered necrobiotic zones. Granuloma annulare more often has palisading granulomas with mucin. Lupus vulgaris displays tuberculoid granulomas and is usually accompanied by ulceration and a positive tuberculosis test. Rheumatoid nodules have a central area of fibrinoid necrosis surrounded by palisaded histiocytes and are seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis."

He reports that some of these plaques developed central ulceration over the past few months. On exam, the involved areas are atrophic with evidence of central ulceration in 2 of the lesions, surrounded by telangiectasia. Laboratory evaluation reveals a mildly elevated HbA1c, but no other systemic findings. Which of the following best describes the underlying condition and its typical management?",
    "choices": [
      "Necrobiosis lipoidica; high-potency topical steroids under occlusion, may require intralesional steroids or immunomodulators",
      "Diabetic dermopathy; controlled with strict glycemic control and topical retinoids",

    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This scenario describes necrobiosis lipoidica (NL), which presents as yellow-brown atrophic plaques with a violaceous (red-brown) inflammatory border, most often on the legs and sometimes ulcerating centrally. Only a subset of NL patients have diabetes, but it is a classic association. Topical high-potency steroids under occlusion are first-line; refractory cases may require intralesional steroids, topical tacrolimus, PUVA, or antimalarials. Diabetic dermopathy would present with brown atrophic macules rather than plaques and has no effective treatment. Other options do not fit the clinical presentation or recommended management."

He now presents with high-grade fever, generalized morbilliform rash, facial edema, tender lymphadenopathy, and malaise. Laboratory investigations reveal leukocytosis with eosinophilia and atypical lymphocytes, elevated transaminases, and mild proteinuria. Shortly after admission, he develops shortness of breath and a chest X-ray shows diffuse interstitial infiltrates. Which of the following best explains the patient's current pulmonary findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Bacterial pneumonia secondary to neutropenia",
      "Diffuse alveolar hemorrhage due to vasculitis",
      "Interstitial pneumonitis as part of a drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms (DRESS) syndrome",

      "Opportunistic infection from immunosuppression"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This patient has developed DRESS syndrome after starting phenytoin, suggested by the triad of widespread rash, fever, and involvement of internal organs (hepatic dysfunction, proteinuria). The progression to pulmonary symptoms with interstitial infiltrates is consistent with interstitial pneumonitis, a known pulmonary manifestation of DRESS. DRESS can affect multiple organs, and interstitial pneumonitis is a recognized, potentially severe complication; it should be distinguished from infectious and thrombotic etiologies. The timing, symptoms, laboratory findings, and multi-organ involvement fit best with DRESS-related lung involvement rather than infection, vasculitis, or thrombosis."

The condition is strongly associated with poor fetal outcomes, including stillbirth, premature birth, and intrapartum fetal distress (particularly at higher bile acid levels). Other maternal complications can include hemorrhage due to decreased vitamin K absorption. The other options either describe different obstetric complications or unrelated dermatologic conditions."

He recently stayed at a crowded shelter. Physical exam reveals multiple excoriated papules and thin, serpiginous, grayish lines in the affected areas. He is otherwise well, with no immunosuppression or prior skin disorders. After initial therapy with topical permethrin cream, his pruritus persists and new lesions develop. Which of the following is the most appropriate next step in management?",
    "choices": [
      "Switch to topical lindane, as it is safe and effective for repeat application in all patients.",
      "Increase the frequency of permethrin application to daily for five days.",
      "Add oral ivermectin, considering his ongoing new lesions despite adequate topical therapy.",
      "Begin oral fluconazole for potential co-existing fungal superinfection.",
      "Use topical griseofulvin for possible dermatophyte infection."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "This man has classic scabies with persistent symptoms despite appropriate permethrin use, raising suspicion for resistance. The best next step is oral ivermectin, which is effective for scabies, especially if topical agents fail. Lindane is neurotoxic and not recommended as first-line or repeat therapy, especially in non-emergent cases. Increasing permethrin frequency above guidelines is not supported. Fluconazole and griseofulvin are antifungals and inappropriate for this parasitic condition."

He recently completed a 2-week course of intravenous foscarnet for acyclovir-resistant herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection. He denies new sexual contacts and has no history of trauma. On exam, there is a sharply demarcated, shallow ulcer on the distal glans with minimal erythema and no inguinal lymphadenopathy. Swabs for HSV PCR are negative. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for this patient's penile lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Herpes simplex virus recrudescence despite therapy",
      "Foscarnet-induced mucocutaneous ulceration",
      "Superimposed bacterial infection due to immunosuppression",
      "Drug-induced fixed drug eruption from acyclovir",
      "Syphilitic chancre due to Treponema pallidum"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Foscarnet is used to treat resistant HSV and CMV infections, particularly in immunocompromised individuals. However, it has been reported to cause mucocutaneous ulcerations, most characteristically on the glans penis, likely related to the high urinary concentration of the drug and local irritation. These ulcers are typically well-demarcated and not associated with HSV or bacterial pathogens. Lack of systemic symptoms, negative HSV PCR, and the clear temporal association with foscarnet administration support this diagnosis. This is a rare but important adverse effect to recognize, especially in patients with advanced HIV infection."

The lesion is indurated, nodular, and appears to have a 'protuberant' component, with overlying atrophic skin changes. He has no history of trauma, immunosuppression, or systemic symptoms. Excisional biopsy reveals spindle-shaped cells arranged in a storiform pattern infiltrating the subcutaneous tissue, with positive CD34 immunostaining and negative S100 and desmin markers. What is the most likely diagnosis?",

    "explanation": "This scenario describes a slow-growing but locally aggressive cutaneous tumor on the trunk, with clinical features of a protuberant nodule and atrophic overlying skin. Histology with storiform spindle cells, CD34 positivity, and negativity for S100 and desmin fits classic dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans (DFSP). Epithelioid sarcoma, angiosarcoma, and leiomyosarcoma show different histologic and immunophenotypic features. Undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma (formerly MFH) would typically lack the storiform arrangement and CD34 positivity."

    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Highly positive anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), particularly when detected by ELISA or immunofluorescence using Crithidia luciliae. This finding correlates with renal disease (lupus nephritis), low complement levels, and portends a worse prognosis. It is not characteristic of drug-induced lupus, CREST, MCTD, or Sj\u00f6gren\u2019s. The peripheral/rim ANA pattern is also specific for anti-dsDNA antibodies in SLE."

He reports intermittent fevers, arthralgias, and weight loss. Past medical history is significant for hepatitis C infection. Physical exam reveals no lymphadenopathy but the nodules are deep, indurated, and show overlying livedo reticularis. Laboratory tests show an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate and low complement levels. A deep skin biopsy demonstrates a lobular neutrophilic panniculitis with vasculitis of small and medium-sized arteries and veins, and areas of fat necrosis.

It is associated with underlying conditions such as tuberculosis and hepatitis C infection. Key features are lobular neutrophilic panniculitis, vasculitis, and areas of fat necrosis on histology. Low complement levels and systemic symptoms help distinguish it from erythema nodosum and other panniculitides. Polyarteritis nodosa may have similar vessel involvement but more systemic findings; lupus panniculitis generally presents with firm, deep nodules and overlying lupus changes. Sweet syndrome is typically a superficial neutrophilic dermatosis without panniculitis or vasculitis."

Choice 4 (Ash leaf macules and cortical tubers on brain MRI) best aligns with tuberous sclerosis. Osteopoikilosis (choice 1) is associated with Buschke-Ollendorff syndrome, while asymmetrical overgrown limbs (choice 2) point to Proteus syndrome.

      "Marked mucin deposition and periappendageal infiltrate on histology",
      "Granulation tissue and eosinophils in biopsy"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes subacute cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SCLE), supported by annular plaques with photosensitivity, mild scaling, and lack of scarring or atrophy. DIF findings are key: SCLE is characterized by immune complex (IgG, IgM) deposition along the DEJ and uniquely by granular fluorescence in the cytoplasm and nuclei of basal keratinocytes due to binding to Ro (SS-A) and La (SS-B) antigens. A positive anti-Ro (SS-A) antibody test would further support this. In contrast, discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE) is more likely to show scarring/atrophy, linear BMZ IgG/C3 is a hallmark of pemphigoid disorders, mucin and periappendageal infiltrate are more typical of dermatomyositis, and granulation tissue/eosinophils are features of a healing ulcer or infiltrative process, not lupus."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man undergoes a submandibular neck dissection for metastatic cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. During the procedure, the surgeon encounters troublesome bleeding in the region of the medial orbital rim, where the vascular network supplies the upper face. To achieve hemostasis, the decision is made to ligate one of the arteries involved. Postoperatively, the patient develops necrosis of the nasal ala and persistent periorbital edema. Which of the following arteries, if inadvertently ligated, is most likely responsible for these complications because of its anastomoses with branches of the external carotid artery?",
    "choices": [
      "Superior labial artery",
      "Angular artery",
      "Transverse facial artery",
      "Deep temporal artery",
      "Inferior alveolar artery"
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The angular artery is the terminal branch of the facial artery (a branch of the external carotid artery) that ascends along the side of the nose and anastomoses with the dorsal nasal branch of the ophthalmic artery (a branch of the internal carotid artery) near the medial canthus. Ligation of the angular artery can compromise collateral blood flow between the ECA and ICA systems and result in tissue necrosis and edema in the supplied regions (like the nasal ala and periorbital tissues). Other listed arteries do not form this critical anastomosis in the region."

    "question": "A 32-year-old man presents with chronic, symmetric, well-demarcated, erythematous plaques with silvery scale on his elbows, knees, and scalp. He reports that the lesions worsen during emotional stress and improve with sunlight. Initial topical corticosteroids and vitamin D analogues provided only partial relief. A recent biopsy confirmed the presence of parakeratosis, regular acanthosis, and a dense neutrophilic infiltrate in the stratum corneum. Recent laboratory research identified upregulation of the IL-23/TH17 axis in this patient\u2019s skin. Based on current understanding of cytokine pathogenesis in psoriasis, which therapy specifically targets the key cytokine involved in the survival and proliferation of TH17 cells in this disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Etanercept (TNF-\u03b1 inhibitor)",
      "Secukinumab (IL-17A inhibitor)",
      "Ustekinumab (IL-12/23 p40 inhibitor)",
      "Guselkumab (IL-23 p19 inhibitor)",
      "Anakinra (IL-1 receptor antagonist)"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Guselkumab is a monoclonal antibody that specifically targets the p19 subunit of IL-23. IL-23 is essential for the survival and proliferation of TH17 cells, which play a central role in the pathogenesis of psoriasis. Ustekinumab targets the shared p40 subunit of IL-12 and IL-23, affecting both pathways but is less selective for IL-23-driven disease. Secukinumab targets IL-17A, a downstream effector cytokine. Etanercept targets TNF-\u03b1, a more general inflammatory mediator. Anakinra is an IL-1 receptor antagonist, not directly involved in the TH17/IL-23 axis in psoriasis. Thus, Guselkumab is the most specific agent for the described mechanistic pathway."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents with a slow-growing, firm nodule on his cheek that has been present for over a year. The lesion is non-tender, measuring 1.2 cm, and is mobile over the underlying structures. Dermoscopic examination reveals a yellowish hue with a hint of overlying telangiectasias. Histopathology demonstrates nests of basaloid cells admixed with areas of sebaceous differentiation, and the neoplasm spares the epidermis. The lesion does not invade the underlying muscle, and there is an absence of significant cytologic atypia or increased mitotic activity. Which of the following is the most appropriate management for this lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Wide local excision with 1 cm margins due to high risk for metastasis",
      "Observation only, as the lesion is likely to spontaneously regress",
      "Complete excision with narrow margins, as the lesion is benign but may recur locally",
      "Mohs micrographic surgery due to high recurrence risk and aggressive behavior",
      "Cryotherapy, as it is most effective for this type of neoplasm"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical and histopathological description best fits a benign sebaceous neoplasm, such as a sebaceoma or sebaceous adenoma. These tumors are typically slow-growing, well-circumscribed, and non-invasive, with no significant atypia or mitotic activity. The most appropriate management is complete excision with narrow margins. Observation is not recommended due to the risk of local recurrence. Wide local excision or Mohs surgery is not necessary as there is no evidence of aggressive or malignant histological features. Cryotherapy is generally not effective for this type of adnexal neoplasm."

    "question": "A 56-year-old man presents with several months of persistent, scaly, erythematous patches on his trunk and proximal extremities. The lesions are slightly pruritic, and some have recently evolved into well-demarcated plaques. A skin biopsy from a patch reveals atypical lymphocytes with cerebriform nuclei aligned in a single file at the dermoepidermal junction and scattered within the epidermis. Another biopsy from a plaque shows clusters of atypical lymphocytes within the epidermis forming small abscesses. Which of the following histopathological findings would most strongly suggest folliculotropic mycosis fungoides in a new facial lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Clusters of atypical lymphocytes (Pautrier's microabscesses) confined to the epidermis",
      "Atypical lymphocytes lining the dermoepidermal junction",
      "A dense infiltrate of atypical lymphocytes and eosinophils in the dermis with ulceration",
      "Atypical lymphocytes infiltrating follicular epithelium with associated mucin deposition",
      "Wedge-shaped infiltrate of neutrophils with epidermal pustules"
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Folliculotropic MF is characterized by the infiltration of atypical lymphocytes within and around the follicular epithelium, often with mucinous degeneration (follicular mucinosis). This is distinct from the patch and plaque stages of classic MF or other cutaneous lymphoproliferative disorders. Pautrier\u2019s microabscesses and lining up of lymphocytes at the DEJ are findings in the classic stages but not specific for the folliculotropic variant. The presence of mucin and follicular infiltration is key for diagnosing the folliculotropic form."

You have prescribed topical corticosteroids for his flare-ups, but he is reluctant to continue them because of concerns about skin thinning. On examination, you note widespread erythematous, excoriated patches without signs of skin atrophy. You consider starting a topical phosphodiesterase-4 inhibitor. He asks about the differences between available topical and oral immunomodulatory agents for his condition. Which of the following statements is most accurate regarding the mechanisms and properties of these treatments?",
    "choices": [
      "Cortisone is a potent topical corticosteroid commonly used for its high glucocorticoid activity.",
      "Apremilast and crisaborole both inhibit phosphodiesterase-4, reducing pro-inflammatory signaling.",
      "Topical PDE4 inhibitors like crisaborole primarily decrease the release of lysosomal enzymes by macrophages.",
      "Long-acting corticosteroids such as betamethasone have minimal mineralocorticoid activity compared to cortisone or hydrocortisone.",
      "In atopic dermatitis, topical PDE4 inhibitors increase circulating eosinophil counts, improving inflammation control."
    ],
    "correct": 3,
    "explanation": "Betamethasone (long-acting corticosteroid) has little to no mineralocorticoid activity, whereas cortisone and hydrocortisone (short-acting) have the highest mineralocorticoid activity. Apremilast (oral) is a PDE4 inhibitor, as is crisaborole (topical), but apremilast is not topical. Crisaborole's mechanism involves reducing inflammatory cell recruitment, not primarily lysosomal enzyme release. There is no evidence that PDE4 inhibitors increase eosinophil counts. Cortisone has low glucocorticoid (not high) and higher mineralocorticoid activity."

    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes abrupt onset of painful, edematous, coin-shaped/cockade purpuric plaques with central clearing and scalloped borders, favoring the face, ears, distal extremities, and scrotum, in the absence of systemic features or mucosal involvement. This is characteristic of acute hemorrhagic edema of infancy (AHEI), a benign leukocytoclastic vasculitis that may be triggered by infections or drug exposure (such as amoxicillin/PCN). Urticarial vasculitis is more common in middle-aged women and often has an association with systemic autoimmune diseases. Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura typically presents with palpable purpura, abdominal pain, and possible renal involvement, not the described plaques. Erythema multiforme involves target lesions often with mucosal involvement. Kawasaki disease is a systemic vasculitis with mucocutaneous findings, high fever, and lymphadenopathy, not the described isolated skin plaques."

Review of systems reveals mild joint aches but no cough or visual changes. Examination shows no scale, pustules, or ulceration. Her past history includes an old laceration scar on her arm that now appears raised, firm, and violaceous. Chest X-ray reveals bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely histopathologic finding in a skin biopsy of one of her facial lesions?",

The systemic features (arthralgias, hilar lymphadenopathy) support the diagnosis. The histologic hallmark is non-caseating compact granulomas in the dermis, surrounded by few lymphocytes ('naked granulomas'). The other options describe findings in other diseases: A \u2013 secondary syphilis; C \u2013 psoriasis; D \u2013 granuloma annulare; E \u2013 erythema nodosum or panniculitis, which may be a nonspecific finding in sarcoidosis but not characteristic of specific sarcoidal lesions."

Stanozolol and danazol are synthetic derivatives of testosterone with anabolic activity, which increase hepatic production of C1 esterase inhibitor and are used as prophylactic treatment for hereditary angioedema. The other options are not indicated for hereditary angioedema: B-VEC is for dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa, prednisone is not effective, colchicine is mainly for neutrophil-driven diseases like Beh\u00e7et's and FMF, and potassium iodide is used for neutrophilic dermatoses."

On examination, there are well-demarcated, hypopigmented, oval patches, with some barely perceptible fine scale on gentle scraping (the 'scratch sign'). Sensory examination over the patches is normal. Wood\u2019s lamp examination shows faint accentuation of the hypopigmented areas. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",

He has a history of chronic venous insufficiency and spends most of his day sitting. Exam reveals bilateral pitting edema and hyperpigmented plaques with overlying scaling and excoriation. The patient denies new exposure to potential irritants or allergens and has not started any new medications. A biopsy of the affected skin shows spongiotic dermatitis with superficial perivascular infiltrate, hemosiderin deposition, and no evidence of eosinophilic spongiosis.

The biopsy shows spongiotic changes and hemosiderin (from red cell leakage), confirming stasis dermatitis. Acute allergic contact dermatitis typically has more vesiculation and eosinophilic spongiosis; lichen simplex chronicus is usually localized to a single area of habitual scratching; pityriasis rosea presents with a herald patch and a Christmas tree rash; subacute spongiotic dermatitis may occur in many contexts but doesn't have the stasis/venous insufficiency/hyperpigmentation features seen here."

    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "Langerhans cell histiocytosis (LCH) may involve the bones, particularly the jaw in children and young adults, and presents as alveolar bone loss with 'floating teeth' on dental X-ray. Skin lesions may be absent, and there can be involvement of lymph nodes, bone marrow, or the endocrine system (such as diabetes insipidus if the skull is involved). Juvenile xanthogranuloma typically presents in infants or young children as yellowish-orange cutaneous papules, and not as destructive oral lesions. Aggressive periodontitis can cause tooth loss, but would not cause the characteristic bony radiologic appearance of 'floating teeth'. Burkitt lymphoma may involve the jaw but presents differently, often in younger children, and without the classic radiology seen in LCH. Chronic granulomatous disease does not feature these dental or bony findings."

On examination, you notice multiple hairs with split ends (trichoptilosis) and otherwise normal-appearing scalp skin. Which of the following is the most likely explanation for her symptoms based on hair structure and physiology?",
    "choices": [
      "Defective activity of follicular melanocytes during anagen causing hair shaft weakening",
      "Repeated damage to the hair cuticle by physical or chemical means leading to loss of fiber integrity",
      "Premature conversion of terminal hair to vellus hair resulting in fragile hair",

Given these findings, which of the following is the most appropriate next step in her management?",
    "choices": [
      "Start high-dose corticosteroid therapy for presumed dermatomyositis and monitor for response.",
      "Screen for underlying malignancy given increased risk associated with this diagnosis.",
      "Order direct immunofluorescence to rule out bullous pemphigoid as the cause.",
      "Arrange referral for muscle biopsy to confirm diagnosis before initiating treatment.",
      "Begin topical corticosteroid therapy to treat her cutaneous findings."
    ],
    "correct": 1,
    "explanation": "The clinical presentation, labs, and histopathology are consistent with dermatomyositis, which has a strong association with underlying malignancy in adults. Malignancy risk is a critical consideration, so cancer screening is an essential next step. Immunosuppressive treatment should be started soon, but missing a paraneoplastic cancer could have dire consequences. Direct immunofluorescence and muscle biopsy may be helpful, but they are not the most urgent step given the classic features. Topical corticosteroids are insufficient for systemic disease."

    "question": "A 62-year-old man presents with several rapidly developing violaceous plaques on his trunk over the past month. He recently began chemotherapy for acute myelogenous leukemia. Examination reveals multiple, indurated, non-tender plaques with sharply demarcated borders, some showing slight scaling. A skin biopsy reveals a diffuse dermal infiltrate of atypical mononuclear cells separated from the epidermis by a narrow grenz zone. The infiltrate consists of mitotically active cells arranged in a jagged, infiltrative pattern, occasionally appearing in single files between collagen bundles. Immunohistochemistry for CD68 and myeloperoxidase is performed. Which of the following findings is most consistent with this patient's skin lesion?",
    "choices": [
      "Sheets of mature-appearing lymphocytes with admixed eosinophils and plasma cells, and minimal cytologic atypia.",
      "Dense infiltration of large, pleomorphic cells with scant inflammatory admixture and conspicuous nucleoli, positive for CD20.",
      "Dermal infiltrate of jagged, mitotically active mononuclear cells separated by a grenz zone, often with single-file arrangements between collagen bundles, positive for myeloperoxidase.",
      "Nodular aggregates of small lymphocytes with plasma cells and granulomatous foci, negative for myeloperoxidase.",
      "Superficial and deep perivascular lymphohistiocytic infiltrate with prominent eosinophils and flame figures."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "The clinical scenario describes leukemia cutis in a patient with known acute myelogenous leukemia. Key histologic clues include the grenz zone, jagged infiltrative pattern, mitotically active mononuclear cells, and arrangement between collagen bundles. Myeloperoxidase positivity is specific for myeloid lineage. Option 3 fits this pattern. Option 1 describes a low-grade lymphoma; option 2 describes a high-grade B cell lymphoma; option 4 is more consistent with inflammatory or low-grade hematolymphoid processes; option 5 fits Wells syndrome (eosinophilic cellulitis), not leukemia cutis."

    "question": "A 22-year-old man presents to your clinic with persistent acne on his face and upper back, characterized by numerous inflamed papules, pustules, and several open comedones. He reports that over-the-counter benzoyl peroxide and clindamycin gel provided minimal improvement. He is concerned about new, painful nodules that occasionally leave dark marks and shallow scars. He has no significant medical history and is otherwise healthy. On examination, you note erythematous papules, pustules, open and closed comedones, as well as a few nodulocystic lesions on his back. Which of the following explains the primary pathophysiologic trigger for his inflammatory acne lesions?",
    "choices": [
      "Direct follicular blockage by keratinocyte proliferation without inflammation",
      "An immediate hypersensitivity reaction to bacterial antigens in sebum",
      "Activation of Toll-like receptor 2 by Propionibacterium acnes leading to local pro-inflammatory cytokine production",
      "Overproduction of sebaceous lipids leading to direct cytotoxicity to hair follicles",
      "Ischemic injury of dermal blood vessels triggering neutrophilic infiltration"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Inflammatory acne lesions are primarily triggered by activation of innate immunity. Research has shown that Propionibacterium acnes (now Cutibacterium acnes) activates Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) on keratinocytes and monocytes in the follicular wall. This activation leads to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1\u03b1, contributing to inflammation and the clinical development of papules, pustules, and nodulocystic lesions. Other options do not represent the key immunopathogenic step observed in inflammatory acne."

    "question": "A previously healthy 68-year-old man develops tense blisters on his trunk and flexural surfaces, preceded by pruritic urticarial plaques. Biopsies reveal a subepidermal blister with numerous eosinophils and linear IgG and C3 deposition along the basement membrane zone on direct immunofluorescence. Autoantibodies from his serum are directed against a structural protein that interacts intracellularly with BPAg1 and plectin, and extracellularly with laminin 5. Which of the following proteins is the most likely principal autoantigen in this patient's disease?",
    "choices": [
      "Desmoglein 3",
      "BPAg1 (BP230)",
      "Plectin",
      "Laminin 5",
      "BPAg2 (BP180; Collagen XVII)"
    ],
    "correct": 4,
    "explanation": "This clinical scenario describes bullous pemphigoid. The principal autoantigen in bullous pemphigoid is BPAg2 (BP180), a transmembrane collagen (collagen XVII) found in hemidesmosomes. BP180 interacts intracellularly with BPAg1 and plectin, and extracellularly with laminin 5. The NC16A domain of BP180 is the major target of pathogenic autoantibodies in bullous pemphigoid. BPAg1 (BP230) is also a target, but it is intracellular and less pathogenic. Desmoglein 3 is associated with pemphigus vulgaris. Plectin and laminin 5 are not primary antigens in bullous pemphigoid."

    "question": "A 28-year-old man presents with a 2-week history of multiple painful pustules and nodules on his face and upper trunk, some of which have coalesced to form shallow ulcers with purulent discharge. He is an otherwise healthy swimming instructor and denies any recent travel or contact with sick individuals. He reports using topical corticosteroids for acne in the last month. Bacterial cultures from a pustule grow methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). He is started on oral doxycycline but shows little improvement after 10 days. What is the next most appropriate antibiotic choice for this patient?",
    "choices": [
      "Increase the dose of doxycycline",
      "Switch to oral erythromycin",
      "Initiate oral co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole)",
      "Start intravenous penicillin G",
      "Begin oral ciprofloxacin"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Oral co-trimoxazole is a recommended alternative for cutaneous MRSA infections when tetracyclines, such as doxycycline, are ineffective or not tolerated. Macrolides, like erythromycin, are less reliable due to high resistance among MRSA strains. Penicillin G is ineffective against MRSA. Fluoroquinolones, such as ciprofloxacin, are generally not recommended due to resistance and poor efficacy. Increasing doxycycline is unlikely to help if there is a lack of response at an adequate dose."

    "question": "A 58-year-old man with a history of rheumatoid arthritis managed with methotrexate and recent initiation of a TNF-alpha inhibitor presents for a routine skin check. He has Fitzpatrick skin type II and reports a remote history of severe sunburns in his youth but no family history of skin cancer. On examination, you note several actinic keratoses and a new, irregularly-pigmented 1.4 cm macule on his upper back. Biopsy reveals superficial spreading melanoma. Which of the following statements best reflects the patient's risk factors for skin malignancies based on his medication regimen and clinical scenario?",
    "choices": [
      "Methotrexate and TNF-alpha inhibitors synergistically cause direct DNA damage, markedly increasing the risk for both ultraviolet-induced and genetically-driven melanomas.",
      "Methotrexate therapy primarily increases squamous cell carcinoma risk, and addition of a TNF-alpha inhibitor carries no further skin cancer risk in all populations.",
      "Exposure to both methotrexate and biologic agents cumulatively increases risk for both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancers, especially in patients with additional risk factors such as prior sunburns and fair skin.",
      "All immunosuppressive agents\u2014including methotrexate, TNF-alpha inhibitors, and small molecule inhibitors\u2014increase only the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer but not melanoma.",
      "Risk of skin cancer with TNF-alpha inhibitors is independent of prior sun exposure and Fitzpatrick skin type."
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Current evidence shows that methotrexate increases the risk for nonmelanoma skin cancers, such as squamous cell carcinoma, while TNF-alpha inhibitors (biologics) also increase the risk for both melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer. The risk is additive, particularly in patients with pre-existing risk factors such as a history of sunburns and fair skin. Notably, the risk of melanoma is not entirely independent of traditional risk factors, and both immunosuppressant use and sun exposure play roles. Thus, option 3 is correct."

    "question": "A 60-year-old man presents with a slow-growing, solitary, erythematous nodule on the forehead that has recently become ulcerated. The lesion measures 1.5 cm and is firm with rolled borders. Dermatoscopy reveals arborizing blood vessels. A biopsy is performed, and histopathology demonstrates nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading, retraction artifact, and mucinous stroma. Immunohistochemistry shows positivity for BerEP4 and negativity for EMA. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
    "choices": [
      "Nodular basal cell carcinoma",
      "Squamous cell carcinoma",
      "Trichoepithelioma",
      "Sebaceous carcinoma",
      "Merkel cell carcinoma"
    ],
    "correct": 0,
    "explanation": "This vignette describes a classic basal cell carcinoma (BCC): slow-growing ulcerated nodule with rolled borders and arborizing vessels (dermatoscopy). Histologically, BCCs show nests of basaloid cells with peripheral palisading and retraction artifact. BerEP4 positivity (an epithelial marker) supports BCC, while EMA negativity helps rule out adnexal carcinomas such as sebaceous carcinoma. Trichoepithelioma can simulate BCC, but is usually smaller, non-ulcerated, and shows different histology. Merkel cell carcinoma would have different immunoprofile (CK20+). Squamous cell carcinomas typically show keratinization and intercellular bridges, not palisading. Therefore, the answer is 'Nodular basal cell carcinoma.'"

    "question": "A 34-year-old woman presents with patchy hair loss on the scalp. Examination reveals multiple areas of scarring alopecia. Scalp biopsies show perifollicular lichenoid inflammation and pronounced perifollicular fibrosis 'pushing out' the inflammatory infiltrate. There is no evidence of follicular plugging, hyperkeratosis, perieccrine inflammation, or increased mucin. Which diagnosis is most consistent with these clinical and histologic findings?",
    "choices": [
      "Discoid lupus erythematosus (DLE)",
      "Central centrifugal cicatricial alopecia (CCCA)",
      "Lichen planopilaris (LPP)",
      "Alopecia areata",
      "Folliculitis decalvans"
    ],
    "correct": 2,
    "explanation": "Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is characterized by patchy scarring alopecia with pronounced perifollicular fibrosis that 'pushes out' the perifollicular lichenoid inflammation. The absence of features such as follicular plugging, hyperkeratosis, perieccrine inflammation, or increased mucin makes DLE less likely. CCCA is also a scarring alopecia but histologic features do not reliably distinguish it from LPP or DLE. The findings in this case are most consistent with LPP."
